        "(CNN)President Donald Trump won't release the Democratic rebuttal to the Republican intelligence memo alleging FBI abuses of its surveillance authority at this time, and has sent it back to the House Intelligence Committee for changes.In a letter to the committee, White House counsel Donald McGahn said, 'although the President is inclined to declassify the February 5th Memorandum, because the Memorandum contains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages, he is unable to do so at this time.''It's gonna be released soon,' Trump told reporters at the White House, adding, 'We're going to release a letter.'The House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously on Monday to release the 10-page Democratic memo, and the committee rules gave Trump five days to decide whether to block or allow its release.The memo from Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, was written to rebut the Republican memo released one week prior, which accuses the FBI of suppressing Democratic ties to an opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia used in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.Schiff and other Democrats charge that the Republican memo led by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes of California is misleading and omits key facts, including that the FISA application did state that ex-British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier, was paid by a political entity.'The Democratic response sets out the material facts that were necessary for the public to see that the FBI acted properly in seeking a FISA warrant on Carter Page,' Schiff said in a statement. 'After promising to treat the Democratic response in precisely the same way, the White House now seeks to have the Democratic memo sent back to committee and revised by the same Majority that produced the flawed Nunes document to begin with.'The White House included a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray that says they have identified portions of the Democratic memo that would raise national security or law enforcement concerns if released publicly.Trump cited concerns from the Justice Department and FBI in his objection to releasing the Democratic memo. But Trump ignored those concerns when he decided to release the Republican memo last week -- despite the FBI releasing a rare statement to say the Nunes memo omitted key information and the Justice Department raising 'grave concerns' about its release without proper review.Trump's objection puts the committee in uncharted waters, as the committee used an obscure rule that had never been invoked before to vote to release both memos.The White House allowed the Nunes memo to be made public. But with the objection to the Democratic memo, there is a procedure available to the House to override the objection and make it public anyway.That would require a vote of the full House after a rare debate in closed session for the full chamber.But it's not clear whether Republicans will be willing to take that step, and the GOP committee members were hesitant about defying Trump on the memo earlier this week.At the committee's Monday meeting where it voted to release the memo, Nunes expressed concerns that the Democratic memo went further than the Republican document in disclosing sources and methods.'This memo contains a large volume of classified information, including some touching on sources and methods heightening the potential damage to national security,' Nunes said.Schiff said he gave his memo to the Justice Department and FBI so they could review for national security concerns in addition to just a White House review, as he expressed concerns there would be 'political redactions' to the memo.'In order to rebut the errors, omissions and distortions in the Republican-drafted memo, we have included certain details beyond the revelations made public by the release of the majority's document,' Schiff said.Democrats immediately cried foul at the decision to send the Democratic memo back to the committee.'The President's double standard when it comes to transparency is appalling,' Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement. 'The rationale for releasing the Nunes memo, transparency, vanishes when it could show information that's harmful to him. Millions of Americans are asking one simple question: what is he hiding?'",
        `(CNN)President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address on Tuesday. Read the President's speech as prepared for delivery and released by the White House: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People -- and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission -- to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the 'Cajun Navy,' racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives. Thank you, Ashlee. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us too. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else -- we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it. So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans' 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half. This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system -- and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month. We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year -- forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual mandate is now gone. We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income. Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing -- a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Please join me in congratulating Corey. Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. This is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight -- no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything. Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is 'in God we trust.' And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston: a job well done. Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem. Americans love their country. And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve -- and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. All Americans deserve accountability and respect -- and that is what we are giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers -- and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history. We have ended the war on American Energy -- and we have ended the war on clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world. In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America's autoworkers -- so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing -- for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming back. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure -- I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the 'right to try.' One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down. America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation's wealth. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year -- is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment -- to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process -- getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance. Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th Birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320 million hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again. The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise. So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans -- to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez -- he goes by CJ. CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ's murder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13. Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise -- one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs. The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age -- that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. @h@The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country -- and it finally ends the dangerous practice of 'catch and release.' The third pillar ends the visa lottery -- a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system -- one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future. In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford. It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult -- but, as Americans always do, we will prevail. As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: 'You will do it -- because you can.' He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense. For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated. Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city. Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery. Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin's selfless love for a fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a 'V' for 'Valor.' Staff Sergeant Peck: All of America salutes you. Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi. So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay. I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa'ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists -- wherever we chase them down. Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this recognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year. That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America's friends. As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies. Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June -- horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return. Otto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight -- along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with American resolve. Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves -- permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had -- and he resolved to be free. Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death. Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth. Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom. It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that, together, they could light up the world. That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga -- to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond. And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia. And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol. This living monument to the American people. A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us -- defending hope, pride, and the American way. They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them. Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again. As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.

        "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Hope Hicks, his communications director and one of his closest confidantes, amid the fallout from the Rob Porter scandal, people familiar with the matter say.Meanwhile, the President has told associates he's dismayed at how the allegations involving his former staff secretary accused of domestic abuse were handled, but he isn't certain how to solve the mushrooming controversy, a person familiar with the conversations tells CNN.Trump was not consulted when Hicks and several other aides drafted a White House statement defending Porter, and he is under the impression that Hicks has let her romantic relationship with Porter cloud her judgment, a source familiar said.In the aftermath, Trump has told associates he feels that Hicks put her own priorities ahead of his. However, there is little to indicate that Hicks' standing is in jeopardy.Speaking during the White House briefing on Thursday, spokesman Raj Shah said Hicks had recused herself from some matters related to the Porter fallout. Porter was in the building for a short period to clean out his desk, Shah said.Trump is 'very disturbed by the negative press attention' the Porter story received, a source close to the President said on Friday.Trump's senior aides knew for months about the allegations levied against Porter by his ex-wives, even as Porter's stock in the West Wing continued to rise, multiple sources have told CNN. Porter denied the allegations but resigned on Wednesday.There is growing frustration among Trump's aides and allies in and out of the White House that chief of staff John Kelly badly mishandled the situation against Porter, one of his top deputies. Sources say he knew about some claims that Porter physically and emotionally battered two ex-wives, yet didn't conduct an internal investigation into their veracity.Trump has spent the last two nights phoning friends and former aides to seek their advice, which has varied wildly. Some have told him the episode is a sign he must clean house. Others say drastic moves -- such as firing Kelly -- would only plunge the West Wing into further chaos.Trump has regularly vented to his associates about Kelly, who imposed a strict system of information flow when he entered the White House over the summer. Trump has chafed at the restricted access, as have some of his regular contacts who no longer enjoyed unfettered access to the President.Trump has spoken to his former chief of staff Reince Priebus about the current state of affairs in the White House, the person familiar with the conversations said, though not specifically the fallout from the Porter allegations. Priebus told CNN on Friday that he had not discussed the Porter controversy with the President. The two men had lunch at the White House in recent weeks, before the Porter scandal erupted.While the reason isn't yet clear, Trump also has also been quizzing those around him about their opinion of Budget Director Mick Mulvaney in recent weeks. Though he is coy about what he's getting at when he asks about Mulvaney, most aides and associates assume he is referencing the chief of staff position. Mulvaney's profile rose during the government funding talks.",
        "Washington (CNN)Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein visited the White House in December seeking President Donald Trump's help. The top Justice Department official in the Russia investigation wanted Trump's support in fighting off document demands from House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes.But the President had other priorities ahead of a key appearance by Rosenstein on the Hill, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Trump wanted to know where the special counsel's Russia investigation was heading. And he wanted to know whether Rosenstein was  'on my team.'The episode is the latest to come to light portraying a President whose inquiries sometimes cross a line that presidents traditionally have tried to avoid when dealing with the Justice Department, for which a measure of independence is key. The exchange could raise further questions about whether Trump was seeking to interfere in the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into potential collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia and obstruction of justice by the White House.At the December meeting, the deputy attorney general appeared surprised by the President's questions, the sources said. He demurred on the direction of the Russia investigation, which Rosenstein has ultimate authority over now that his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has recused himself. And he responded awkwardly to the President's 'team' request, the sources said.'Of course, we're all on your team, Mr. President,' Rosenstein told Trump, the sources said. It is not clear what Trump meant or how Rosenstein interpreted the comment.Rosenstein's meeting with the President came as Rosenstein prepared to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Trump appeared focused on Rosenstein's testimony, according to a source briefed on the matter, and he brought it up with the deputy attorney general.As a further sign of the President's focus on Rosenstein's testimony, one of the sources said Trump also had suggested questions to members of Congress that they could ask Rosenstein.One line of inquiry Trump proposed lawmakers ask about was whether Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election because Mueller was not selected as FBI director. CNN has reported that Trump has been venting to his aides about Rosenstein in recent weeks and even raised the possibility of his removal. Sources say Trump believes Rosenstein was upset Mueller wasn't selected as FBI director and responded by making him special counsel. It does not appear those questions were asked of Rosenstein at the hearing.Rosenstein's December 13 appearance before the committee included strong backing for Mueller. He also pushed back at Democrats' questions about the President's demands for loyalty.'As long as you are following your oath of office, you can also be faithful to the administration,' he testified.At the hearing, Rosenstein repeatedly declined to say whether Trump had ever asked him about the Russia Investigation. But he testified that he never received any 'improper orders' from Trump and denied that anyone ever asked him to pledge his loyalty, dating back to his time in the Bush administration.'Nobody has asked me to take a loyalty pledge, other than the oath of office,' Rosenstein said.In the first months of his presidency, Trump asked Comey for loyalty, according to Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill and his account to other FBI officials. Comey did not pledge loyalty, and after a few additional tense interactions with Trump, he was fired in May 2017.While searching for Comey's replacement, Trump interviewed acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Trump asked McCabe who he voted for during that interview, according to a source familiar with the matter. McCabe did not vote for president in the 2016 general election but did vote in the Republican primary in Virginia, sources told CNN. Trump has publicly denied that he asked McCabe who he voted for.Seven months later, Rosenstein made his pitch in the December meeting with the President, asking for White House backing as the Justice Department sought to deny access to sensitive documents demanded by Nunes, who has spent months pursuing claims of surveillance abuses by the FBI and the Justice Department against the Trump campaign.White House chief of staff John Kelly later notified the Justice Department that the President would not help block access to the documents.",
        "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Friday called the departure of his former staff secretary Rob Porter following allegations of domestic abuse  'very sad ' and said he wishes Porter  'well. 'The President, in his first public comments since Porter's resignation on Wednesday, did not express any sympathy for the women Porter allegedly abused -- instead pointing to Porter's claim that  'he's innocent. ' 'I found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, ' Trump said.  'We certainly wish him well. It's obviously a very tough time for him. He did a very good job while he was in the White House. 'Trump focused on Porter's denial of the allegations that he struck his two-ex-wives while they were married. 'He says he's innocent, and I think you have to remember that, ' Trump said.  'He said very strongly yesterday that he's innocent, but you'll have to talk to him about that. 'Trump's comments come as chief of staff John Kelly and other top White House officials are facing questions about why they did not act to remove Porter from his position after they found out about the allegations of domestic abuse.Senior aides knew for months about the allegations levied against Porter by his ex-wives, even as Porter's stock in the West Wing continued to rise, multiple sources have told CNN. Porter denied the allegations but resigned on Wednesday.Even after the allegations surfaced publicly, sources told CNN that Kelly did not urge Porter to resign or seek to force him out. Instead, the White House released a statement from Kelly praising Porter's character.It wasn't until the uproar over the allegations grew and more details surfaced that Porter resigned and Kelly put out a second statement expressing concern about the allegations.White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah acknowledged on Thursday the White House  'could have done better ' in its initial response to the allegations, a concession Trump was privately miffed about, CNN has learned.The allegations against Porter and the problematic internal response to the allegations -- which former senior staffers had known about for months -- has led to tensions inside the West Wing, with Kelly's credibility in particular coming under fire.Trump has also grown upset with his White House communications director Hope Hicks, who despite being in a romantic relationship with Porter helped craft the White House's initial pushback to the allegations, a source familiar said.",
        `Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he supports a government shutdown if Democrats won't agree to tighten immigration laws, undercutting ongoing bipartisan negotiations on Capitol Hill.The comment, which came during a White House meeting on the violent MS-13 gang, was not well received in the room. Rep. Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican who represents a district with thousands of federal workers, confronted Trump about the remark and urged him to avoid another government shutdown. 'If we don't change it, let's have a shutdown,' Trump said of the nation's immigration laws. 'We'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country. I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of.'He added: "If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety, and unrelated but still related, they don't want to take care of our military, then shut it down. We'll go with another shutdown."Several Republican aides working on the budget deal have voiced concern to CNN that the President's comments about a shutdown may cause things to fall apart.The issue is whether House Democrats -- who have for months been outright resistant to signing onto a budget agreement without a resolution on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- will now back away from the breakthrough deal negotiators are approaching.The President's remarks happened at the same time Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in separate news conferences, touted the progress on the talks and made clear a deal was close. The talks also separate the issue from immigration altogether -- long the GOP goal -- making the President's comments somewhat confusing."Things are in a good place, but also fragile," another GOP aide said, noting all of the moving parts in the talks. "We could do without anything inflammatory for a couple of days."Speaking shortly after Trump during the White House meeting, Comstock said she would not back such a move and urged Trump to avoid it."We don't need a government shutdown on this," she said. "I think both sides have learned that a government shutdown is bad."At a later event, Comstock described her comments with Trump as "a very civil discussion" and that she doesn't "support government shutdowns.When asked to clarify his remarks at the end of the roundtable, Trump told reporters again that he would shut down the government over immigration."I would shut it down over this issue. I can't speak for everybody at the table but I will tell you, I would shut it down over this issue," he said, adding that if the US doesn't straighten out its borders "we don't have a country. Without borders we don't have a country."Rep. Pete King, R-New York, who attended the White House meeting, told reporters afterward that he doesn't think the government will shutdown over immigration policy, despite Trump's comments.Though Trump opposed that government shutdown, he has previously said the United States could use a government work stoppage.CNN's Elizabeth Landers, Sunlen Serfaty and Donald Judd contributed to this report.`

        `It is a historic spectacle. Washington is transfixed by dueling “memos” between Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee over an FBI application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Carter Page of the Trump presidential campaign.The application included a 35-page “dossier” on Donald Trump prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele.The Washington press corps has kept the Trump-Russia collusion story before the American public for a year, and the president himself, speaking through his Twitter account, says he is the victim of a “witch hunt.”How did this spectacle happen? Two salient and related events occurred on Nov. 8, 2016. Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton for the U.S. presidency. Within hours, the Trump Panic went viral.The Trump Panic of 2016-17 was the belief that the U.S. presidency had fallen into the hands of an unacceptable person—who had to be stopped, or resisted by any means.Historians will record that the Trump Panic gripped all Democrats, some Republicans, scores of intellectuals (such as those who signed documents declaring their refusal to work in the Trump foreign-policy agencies), foreign leaders, journalists, and members of U.S. security agencies.On election day, two FBI officials— Peter Strzok of the bureau’s counterintelligence division and Lisa Page —exchanged text messages.Page: “OMG THIS IS F***ING TERRIFYING.” Strzok: “Omg, I am so depressed.”Recall how routine it was then to hear or read that the new U.S. president resembled Hitler or Mussolini. Democracy was “at risk”—even as such non-Hitlerian pillars as Jim Mattis, Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn joined the government.Let us stipulate it is not beyond imagining that individuals at the FBI’s Washington headquarters or at the Justice Department are Democrats. This is Washington, and the sky is blue. Historically, though, it has been possible to believe a functional distinction existed in these sensitive bureaucracies between political impulse and professional responsibility.Because of the Trump Panic, professional discipline eroded. Exhibit A will always be the Steele dossier. Spend 15 minutes reading it, and you will recognize a textbook example of the Russian Cold War art form of assembling published facts, half-truths, untruths and conspiracies into an eye-popping narrative that would embarrass Frederick Forsyth.From page 33: “Referring back to the (surprise) sacking of Sergei IVANOV as Head of PA in August 2016, his replacement by Anton VAINO and the appointment of former Russian premier Sergei KIRIYENKO to another senior position in the PA, the Kremlin insider repeated that this had been directly connected to the TRUMP support operation and the need to cover up now that it was being exposed by the USG and in the western media.”The Steele dossier is factoids on steroids. In normal times, the FBI would not include it in a submission to the FISA court. The Trump Panic wasn’t normal times. Decisions outside normal boundaries were considered justified.Recall Sally Yates. After President Trump’s legally vulnerable travel-ban order, acting Attorney General Yates wrote, “For as long as I am the acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of th[is] executive order.” You won’t what?By comparison, it is well known that during Barack Obama’s presidency, much of the U.S. military leadership abhorred his policies and directives. It is inconceivable that any of them would have refused to execute a similar order from Mr. Obama.But this was the Trump Panic, and Ms. Yates’s act of professional insubordination elicited approval in an email from Andrew Weissman, head of the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section: “I am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much.”This doesn’t mean the FBI is off the rails. It means a handful of people in Director James Comey’s orbit at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue—products of an insular, inbred Beltway village—lost their professional bearings and succumbed to the zeitgeist of panic over the Trump presidency. Righting that ship is crucial.We wrote at the outset that this is a spectacle. Which brings us, necessarily, to one of its ringmasters— Donald J. Trump.Controversies come and go for any presidency. Some, such as Watergate and Whitewater, kept going because it was possible to report events that truly advanced the story. The Russian collusion story went moribund months ago, with Rep. Adam Schiff reduced this week to waving the Steele dossier as if it were the second coming of the Pumpkin Papers, which revealed Alger Hiss as a Russian dupe.Anyone else in politics would have let the fires under the collusion issue burn down. Is it a potential legal problem? Sure. Should it be a destructive daily bonfire? No.Mr. Trump is combative not for political reasons but because he’s been combative all his life. In the Washington Swamp he has found the ultimate Trumpian arena. The Swamp is his sparring partner. Don’t let the raging tweets fool you. He loves it.`,
        `The Trump administration is backing a set of actions aimed at lowering prescription-drug costs, including a cap on the dollar amount that American seniors pay each year for expensive prescription drugs.The administration wasn’t specific about the dollar amount for the drug cap, and some of the proposals would require congressional action.Alex Azar, the newly confirmed Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the main objectives of the administration’s initiatives were to “reduce out-of-pocket expenses for seniors” and to “increase the ability of the government to get a good deal” in purchasing prescription drugs.“We do think drug prices are too high,” he said.Mr. Azar conducted a press briefing along with Mick Mulvaney, the White House’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, who described lower drug prices as “a top, top priority for the president.”The two senior Trump administration officials laid out a series of proposals that could lead to lower prescription-drug prices, but many of them were lacking in details. Some of the ideas are likely to be fleshed out further on Monday, when the administration is scheduled to release a budget proposal.The plans included making generic drugs available free for senior citizens in the Medicare program and increasing the ability of some state Medicaid programs to use their drug formularies—lists of approved drugs—to drive down the cost of prescription drugs in the state-federal program. That would be a five-state pilot program.It isn’t clear whether Congress would will tackle the proposals that require its approval. Drug-pricing experts, including those working for public-interest groups, generally reacted well to the ideas, but they were skeptical they would have a major impact on drug costs.“Some of these might be progress,” said Peter Maybarduk, the access-to-medicines director at Public Citizen in Washington. “But the savings are small compared to what they might be doing.”He suggested the administration would have a bigger impact by seeking to get direct drug-price negotiation power for the federal government in the Medicare program.A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of Medicare drug costs showed sharp increases in out-of-pocket costs for seniors over the 2011-2015 period. For example, patients paid $4,420 on average in 2015 for the cancer drug Gleevec, an 18% increase from 2011.“Drug prices are higher in the U.S. than in the rest of the industrialized world because, unlike that in nearly every other advanced nation, the U.S. health care system allows manufacturers to set their own price for a given product,” Harvard researchers wrote in JAMA in 2016. Researchers Aaron S. Kesselheim, Jerry Avorn and Ameet Sarpatwari said one solution is “providing greater opportunity for meaningful price negotiation by government payers.”“Right now, costs are a huge issue for people on expensive specialty drugs,” said Peter B. Bach, a drug-cost expert and director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.Dr. Bach said the administration needs to analyze drug companies’ costs more than it currently does. “Every other western country uses some form of analysis” of drug-research costs, he said.Some state officials think that “more limited” lists of approved drugs, or formularies, in their Medicaid programs could be used to “drive better bargains,” Mr. Azar said.He said the federal government is now seeking to approve more such state initiatives, such as one that was proposed recently by the Massachusetts Medicaid program.The administration also called for paying a markup of 3% instead of 6% in part of the federal Medicare program.Medicare in January slashed what it pays some hospitals for certain drugs under a program known as 340B. The move is expected by the Trump administration and health experts to reduce spending on drugs by Medicare enrollees, who pay some of the cost of certain medications. The American Hospital Association and other trade groups sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last year to halt the cuts, but a federal judge dismissed the case. Hospital groups have appealed the court’s decision.— Melanie Evans contributed to this article.Write to Thomas M. Burton at tom.burton@wsj.com`,
        `When President Donald Trump sends his annual budget to Congress next week, it will be largely obsolete because the big decisions on government tax and spending priorities have already been made on Capitol Hill.Last year’s White House budget proposed big cuts in spending programs including food stamps, disability benefits, welfare and student loans, totaling $4.5 trillion over a decade. In the process, it said, it would balance the budget in 10 years.But a lot has changed since then. In December, Republicans passed a tax cut that congressional scorekeepers estimate will increase the deficit by $1 trillion over a decade when accounting for its estimated effects on growth and revenue collections. Then this week, Republicans and Democrats agreed to a plan to break budget caps and spend $300 billion more than previously planned over the next two years.The Trump fiscal 2019 budget—due out on Monday—could again propose large cuts in domestic spending, an even larger boost in military spending and a balanced budget. But to get there, it would have to ignore the political dynamic that recently gave way to large spending increases and higher deficits.A White House budget is a window into an administration’s spending priorities and a regular Washington ritual that helps to set the tone of political debate between and within parties. In this case, said Steve Bell, a longtime Republican budget aide who is now a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, it “has no relevance to what’s going to happen next year in appropriations for fiscal year 2019.”A senior White House budget official on Friday said the president’s 2019 proposal would include an addendum reflecting the higher spending levels Congress set Friday. But the official acknowledged the underlying document—developed over several months—relies on outdated figures. The White House also plans to make recommendations for how Congress should allocate additional funds for the remainder of the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30The House and Senate narrowly approved legislation early Friday morning combining Congress’s budget agreement, which sets overall spending levels for the next two years, with a short-term spending bill to fund the government until March 23, ending a brief government shutdown. The agreement would also raise the government’s self-imposed ceiling on federal borrowing until March 1, 2019.The budget agreement gives congressional committees several weeks to write detailed spending bills. Those measures and the underlying agreement will dictate the direction of federal spending.Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, said Mr. Trump’s budget proposal could help lawmakers fill in some of the details as they write the full-year spending bill in coming weeks. The big issue of deciding how much the government will spend, however, has been largely set, he said.With Democratic and Republican leaders agreeing on a two-year spending plan, WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why the agreement, if it becomes law, could change the way Congress operates. Photo: GettyOther paths toward managing spending appear to be shut off. Mr. Trump said during his election campaign he didn’t want to cut the big entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said in December that entitlements were off limits in 2018.Cuts to other mandatory programs targeted in last year’s budget would be difficult to clear in the Senate without support from Democrats, which seems unlikely.The two-year budget agreement reached this week would increase domestic discretionary spending by about 9.6% from fiscal 2017, which ended last Sept. 30, compared with a roughly 10% decrease under the president’s 2018 budget. It would boost defense spending more than Mr. Trump proposed, to $700 billion this year compared with his $668 billion request, a roughly 10.4% increase from 2017, including emergency war spending.“The president seems to be cheerleading this budget agreement, so it will be a little strange if the president sends a budget request that doesn’t mirror what’s in an agreement that he’s openly advocating for,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.).Independent analysts say the new two-year agreement could boost deficits to $1 trillion by next year, at a time when the deficit as a share of gross domestic product is expected to rise and the economy is operating close to its full potential.Analysts also said Friday it reduced the odds of Congress pursuing a major infrastructure package this year, the one policy initiative Mr. Trump had hoped to advance in 2018.Congressional Republicans in the past have put forward budget resolutions that propose to eliminate the deficit over a decade. This year, House Republicans have discussed the possibility of skipping passage of a budget resolution for fiscal year 2019, since the Senate is unlikely to be able to pass one of its own.“Congress appears to be looking for every excuse to run away from the responsibilities of budgeting,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan nonprofit that advocates for deficit reduction. “They’ll politely nod at the president’s budget, and breathe a sigh of relief that they don’t have to put on paper something where the numbers would be very difficult to get to add up.”—Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com`,
        `Border agents say walls slow down people trying to make their way into the U.S. undetected. But local opposition to a new barrier is mobilizing, showing the challenge to building the structure even if Mr. Trump gets funding. Area politicians, business leaders, environmentalists and farmers call such walls destructive, expensive and ineffective. Last month, hundreds rallied in opposition next to the Santa Ana refuge.A 2017 photo of a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent passing along a section of border levee wall in Hidalgo, Texas.

That traps U.S. property between the wall and the river—including most of the 2,100 acres of the nature reserve. It’s a mecca for birdwatchers who flock to see both migrating and native species: the Green Jay, Peregrin falcons, five types of Kingbird and the seldom seen Crested Caracara.“Anyone who loves nature would be sad about this,” said Bonnie Hill, 65, a retired physician who was visiting the refuge in January from Minneapolis.“There are places they need a wall,” said Robert Draper, a volunteer at the center. “But this is a refuge.”Note: Due to the scale of the map, some gaps in the border fence may not be visible.Sources: Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting and OpenStreetMap contributors (border fence); Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s LandScan data (population density)Within the nature reserve is a levee—an elevated road with sloping dirt banks—-built to guard against floodwaters from the river. The administration wants to convert that into a 15- to 18-foot vertical span of concrete, topped by 18-foot high, tightly packed bollard fencing. Inside the Santa Ana, the levee wall would be yards from the visitor center, with nearly the entire refuge on the other side.That would mark the start of the administration’s quest to convert 60 miles of levees into walls across the Lower Rio Grande Valley, a vast, flat delta home to farmland, teeming towns and nature preserves. The most direct route through Mexico for migrating Central Americans, the valley is the busiest spot in the nation for illegal crossings, accounting for 15% of the southwest border land but 45% of apprehensions.Today, the Border Patrol guards the valley with 3,100 agents and 46 camera towers. Also in place: 55 miles of thick fencing, often topping concrete wall, but with large gaps.Mr. Padilla said he first wants more agents, followed by more technology. He put additional fencing as third priority. But he said he needs all three.“There’s no singular solution,” he said.Crude ladders found from migrants crossing near Hidalgo. Photo: Laura Meckler/The Wall Street JournalThe Border Patrol says existing fencing slows down many illegal crossers, who dash from the river through farmland, heavy brush and bramble, trying to make it to a road where smugglers can carry them away.“Once you cross the road, there are no cameras,” said border agent Robert Rodriguez.He pointed out an area in Hidalgo, a town west of the refuge, where the high fence tops a levee separating wooded river bottom from streets. Before the fence was put up about a decade ago, Mr. Rodriguez said, migrants could spring across the levee and disappear into a flea market. “It was a real, real hot spot,” he said.Created with Highcharts 6.0.4The Great FallThe push for funding for a wall on thesouthwest border comes after years of fallingapprehensions.The push for funding for a wall on the southwest border comes after years of falling apprehensions.Total border patrol apprehensions along theU.S.-Mexico borderTotal border patrol apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico borderSource: U.S. Customs and Border ProtectionNote: Fiscal years end Sept. 30Created with Highcharts 6.0.4.apprehensions20002005201020150250,000500,000750,0001,000,0001,250,0001,500,0001,750,000Still, about a dozen crudely made ladders lay piled nearby, underscoring one of the ways migrants overcome the fence. Mr. Rodriguez said agents had collected them in just a week.The nature reserve’s neighbors are uniting against the border-wall expansion. They don’t want a wall across their property and don’t want their homes or fields located behind it. The Bush administration was forced to file hundreds of eminent-domain lawsuits when it tried to take private land for fencing. It won most, but the suits delayed construction, sometimes for years.“It will split our farm in half and turn the area south of the wall into no man’s land,” said Frank Schuster, whose family has farmed thousands of acres of cotton, vegetable and sugar cane fields flanking the Santa Ana refuge for more than 70 years. “A technology-based fence with boots on the ground keeps the border at the river,” added Mr. Schuster, who voted for Mr. Trump.Created with Highcharts 6.0.4Who Is ApprehendedIn 2017, more than half the apprehensionswere families and children, who typically turnthemselves in to border agents in hopes ofstaying in the U.S.In 2017, more than half the apprehensions were families and children, who typically turn themselves in to border agents in hopes of staying in the U.S. Border patrol apprehensions in the RioGrande Valley sector of the U.S.-Mexicoborder.Border patrol apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector of the U.S.-Mexico border.Source: U.S. Customs and Border ProtectionNote: Fiscal years end Sept. 30Created with Highcharts 6.0.4.apprehensionsFamiliesUnaccompanied children20132014201520162017050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000Becky Schuster Jones, Mr. Schuster’s sister, traveled to Washington to lobby against the project. She worries about her property values, the ability to access land on the other side of the wall and about drug smugglers attacking farmworkers in hopes of getting the code needed to open an access gate. She also frets about how emergency services would reach the land south of the wall.“This is the most un-American thing. People locked out of their own country,” she said.It was partly this sort of local opposition that blocked building in Texas during the Bush years. A 2006 statute mandated construction of 850 miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile border, but Texas’ GOP senators got that pared back to 700 miles a year later.Frank Schuster with his sister Becky Schuster Jones.

That could be deadly to Santa Ana refuge animals, particularly the endangered ocelot, a small wildcat whose movement would be curtailed by a fence.“Nothing that walks or crawls gets over this, except people,” Mr. Nicol said, standing next to an existing levee fence at the nearby Old Hidalgo Pump House, upriver from the Santa Ana refuge. He points to dirt prints on the 18-foot bollard beams atop the wall. “Find a bollard that doesn’t have a hand print on it.”Read MoreWrite to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Dudley Althaus at Dudley.Althaus@wsj.com`,
        `President Trump sent a powerful early message of U.S. resolve last year when he bombed a Syrian air base after the Assad regime used sarin gas against civilians. He may need to send another because Syria has been testing his red line with multiple uses of chlorine gas in recent weeks.The State Department said this week that the United States is “gravely alarmed” by reports that the Syrian government has launched six chemical attacks against civilians over the past 30 days. Assad has dropped chlorine gas on his political opponents for years, but who’s going to stop him?In August 2012 Barack Obama warned of “enormous consequences” if Assad used chemical weapons, dubbing it a “red line.” The next year the dictator killed more than 1,400 people with sarin gas. Mr. Obama responded by signing a deal with Russia to seize Damascus’s chemical arsenal. Chlorine wasn’t included, and U.S. intelligence concluded Assad had retained some chemical stockpiles.Sure enough, the regime used sarin gas against civilians again last April, killing at least 85 people. Mr. Trump explained his missile launch in response as “in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.”But lately the Administration has turned, almost Obama-like, to pleading with Russia to make Assad stop his latest assaults. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson devoted a speech in January to the theme, noting that Moscow “pressed for, negotiated and agreed” to a September 2013 deal to destroy Syria’s “entire chemical weapons stockpile,” and supported a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution to hold chemical weapons users “to account.” Foggy Bottom repeated those pleadings on Monday and again on Thursday.Good luck with that. Last year Russia blocked the renewal of the U.N. panel that was established to investigate Syria’s chemical weapons. Russia now denies that Assad is using chlorine gas, and the U.N. panel isn’t around to document the truth.Moscow also hasn’t fulfilled a single agreement it has made with Mr. Trump. The Kremlin has failed to enforce a “deconfliction” zone in southwestern Syria as it promised to do as part of a 2017 U.S.-Russia agreement, and it is trying to negotiate its own settlement to the civil war outside of the U.N. process in Geneva it previously agreed to use. Moscow wants to keep Assad in power, maintain bases in Syria from which to threaten NATO, and thwart U.S. goals in the Middle East.Meanwhile, in a statement that echoes of Mr. Obama’s hashtag outrage, the State Department said Monday that “the people of Syria are suffering; the rest of the world is watching.” And doing nothing.Appeared in the February 9, 2018, print edition.`,
