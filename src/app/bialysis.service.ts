        "(CNN)President Donald Trump won't release the Democratic rebuttal to the Republican intelligence memo alleging FBI abuses of its surveillance authority at this time, and has sent it back to the House Intelligence Committee for changes.In a letter to the committee, White House counsel Donald McGahn said, 'although the President is inclined to declassify the February 5th Memorandum, because the Memorandum contains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages, he is unable to do so at this time.''It's gonna be released soon,' Trump told reporters at the White House, adding, 'We're going to release a letter.'The House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously on Monday to release the 10-page Democratic memo, and the committee rules gave Trump five days to decide whether to block or allow its release.The memo from Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, was written to rebut the Republican memo released one week prior, which accuses the FBI of suppressing Democratic ties to an opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia used in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.Schiff and other Democrats charge that the Republican memo led by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes of California is misleading and omits key facts, including that the FISA application did state that ex-British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier, was paid by a political entity.'The Democratic response sets out the material facts that were necessary for the public to see that the FBI acted properly in seeking a FISA warrant on Carter Page,' Schiff said in a statement. 'After promising to treat the Democratic response in precisely the same way, the White House now seeks to have the Democratic memo sent back to committee and revised by the same Majority that produced the flawed Nunes document to begin with.'The White House included a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray that says they have identified portions of the Democratic memo that would raise national security or law enforcement concerns if released publicly.Trump cited concerns from the Justice Department and FBI in his objection to releasing the Democratic memo. But Trump ignored those concerns when he decided to release the Republican memo last week -- despite the FBI releasing a rare statement to say the Nunes memo omitted key information and the Justice Department raising 'grave concerns' about its release without proper review.Trump's objection puts the committee in uncharted waters, as the committee used an obscure rule that had never been invoked before to vote to release both memos.The White House allowed the Nunes memo to be made public. But with the objection to the Democratic memo, there is a procedure available to the House to override the objection and make it public anyway.That would require a vote of the full House after a rare debate in closed session for the full chamber.But it's not clear whether Republicans will be willing to take that step, and the GOP committee members were hesitant about defying Trump on the memo earlier this week.At the committee's Monday meeting where it voted to release the memo, Nunes expressed concerns that the Democratic memo went further than the Republican document in disclosing sources and methods.'This memo contains a large volume of classified information, including some touching on sources and methods heightening the potential damage to national security,' Nunes said.Schiff said he gave his memo to the Justice Department and FBI so they could review for national security concerns in addition to just a White House review, as he expressed concerns there would be 'political redactions' to the memo.'In order to rebut the errors, omissions and distortions in the Republican-drafted memo, we have included certain details beyond the revelations made public by the release of the majority's document,' Schiff said.Democrats immediately cried foul at the decision to send the Democratic memo back to the committee.'The President's double standard when it comes to transparency is appalling,' Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement. 'The rationale for releasing the Nunes memo, transparency, vanishes when it could show information that's harmful to him. Millions of Americans are asking one simple question: what is he hiding?'",
        `(CNN)President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address on Tuesday. Read the President's speech as prepared for delivery and released by the White House: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People -- and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission -- to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the 'Cajun Navy,' racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives. Thank you, Ashlee. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us too. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else -- we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it. So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans' 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half. This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system -- and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month. We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year -- forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual mandate is now gone. We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income. Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing -- a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Please join me in congratulating Corey. Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. This is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight -- no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything. Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is 'in God we trust.' And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston: a job well done. Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem. Americans love their country. And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve -- and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. All Americans deserve accountability and respect -- and that is what we are giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers -- and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history. We have ended the war on American Energy -- and we have ended the war on clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world. In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America's autoworkers -- so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing -- for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming back. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure -- I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the 'right to try.' One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down. America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation's wealth. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year -- is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment -- to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process -- getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance. Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th Birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320 million hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again. The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise. So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans -- to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez -- he goes by CJ. CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ's murder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13. Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise -- one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs. The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age -- that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. @h@The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country -- and it finally ends the dangerous practice of 'catch and release.' The third pillar ends the visa lottery -- a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system -- one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future. In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford. It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult -- but, as Americans always do, we will prevail. As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: 'You will do it -- because you can.' He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense. For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated. Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city. Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery. Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin's selfless love for a fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a 'V' for 'Valor.' Staff Sergeant Peck: All of America salutes you. Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi. So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay. I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa'ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists -- wherever we chase them down. Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this recognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year. That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America's friends. As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies. Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June -- horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return. Otto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight -- along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with American resolve. Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves -- permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had -- and he resolved to be free. Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death. Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth. Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom. It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that, together, they could light up the world. That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga -- to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond. And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia. And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol. This living monument to the American people. A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us -- defending hope, pride, and the American way. They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them. Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again. As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.

        "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Hope Hicks, his communications director and one of his closest confidantes, amid the fallout from the Rob Porter scandal, people familiar with the matter say.Meanwhile, the President has told associates he's dismayed at how the allegations involving his former staff secretary accused of domestic abuse were handled, but he isn't certain how to solve the mushrooming controversy, a person familiar with the conversations tells CNN.Trump was not consulted when Hicks and several other aides drafted a White House statement defending Porter, and he is under the impression that Hicks has let her romantic relationship with Porter cloud her judgment, a source familiar said.In the aftermath, Trump has told associates he feels that Hicks put her own priorities ahead of his. However, there is little to indicate that Hicks' standing is in jeopardy.Speaking during the White House briefing on Thursday, spokesman Raj Shah said Hicks had recused herself from some matters related to the Porter fallout. Porter was in the building for a short period to clean out his desk, Shah said.Trump is 'very disturbed by the negative press attention' the Porter story received, a source close to the President said on Friday.Trump's senior aides knew for months about the allegations levied against Porter by his ex-wives, even as Porter's stock in the West Wing continued to rise, multiple sources have told CNN. Porter denied the allegations but resigned on Wednesday.There is growing frustration among Trump's aides and allies in and out of the White House that chief of staff John Kelly badly mishandled the situation against Porter, one of his top deputies. Sources say he knew about some claims that Porter physically and emotionally battered two ex-wives, yet didn't conduct an internal investigation into their veracity.Trump has spent the last two nights phoning friends and former aides to seek their advice, which has varied wildly. Some have told him the episode is a sign he must clean house. Others say drastic moves -- such as firing Kelly -- would only plunge the West Wing into further chaos.Trump has regularly vented to his associates about Kelly, who imposed a strict system of information flow when he entered the White House over the summer. Trump has chafed at the restricted access, as have some of his regular contacts who no longer enjoyed unfettered access to the President.Trump has spoken to his former chief of staff Reince Priebus about the current state of affairs in the White House, the person familiar with the conversations said, though not specifically the fallout from the Porter allegations. Priebus told CNN on Friday that he had not discussed the Porter controversy with the President. The two men had lunch at the White House in recent weeks, before the Porter scandal erupted.While the reason isn't yet clear, Trump also has also been quizzing those around him about their opinion of Budget Director Mick Mulvaney in recent weeks. Though he is coy about what he's getting at when he asks about Mulvaney, most aides and associates assume he is referencing the chief of staff position. Mulvaney's profile rose during the government funding talks.",
        "Washington (CNN)Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein visited the White House in December seeking President Donald Trump's help. The top Justice Department official in the Russia investigation wanted Trump's support in fighting off document demands from House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes.But the President had other priorities ahead of a key appearance by Rosenstein on the Hill, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Trump wanted to know where the special counsel's Russia investigation was heading. And he wanted to know whether Rosenstein was  'on my team.'The episode is the latest to come to light portraying a President whose inquiries sometimes cross a line that presidents traditionally have tried to avoid when dealing with the Justice Department, for which a measure of independence is key. The exchange could raise further questions about whether Trump was seeking to interfere in the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into potential collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia and obstruction of justice by the White House.At the December meeting, the deputy attorney general appeared surprised by the President's questions, the sources said. He demurred on the direction of the Russia investigation, which Rosenstein has ultimate authority over now that his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has recused himself. And he responded awkwardly to the President's 'team' request, the sources said.'Of course, we're all on your team, Mr. President,' Rosenstein told Trump, the sources said. It is not clear what Trump meant or how Rosenstein interpreted the comment.Rosenstein's meeting with the President came as Rosenstein prepared to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Trump appeared focused on Rosenstein's testimony, according to a source briefed on the matter, and he brought it up with the deputy attorney general.As a further sign of the President's focus on Rosenstein's testimony, one of the sources said Trump also had suggested questions to members of Congress that they could ask Rosenstein.One line of inquiry Trump proposed lawmakers ask about was whether Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election because Mueller was not selected as FBI director. CNN has reported that Trump has been venting to his aides about Rosenstein in recent weeks and even raised the possibility of his removal. Sources say Trump believes Rosenstein was upset Mueller wasn't selected as FBI director and responded by making him special counsel. It does not appear those questions were asked of Rosenstein at the hearing.Rosenstein's December 13 appearance before the committee included strong backing for Mueller. He also pushed back at Democrats' questions about the President's demands for loyalty.'As long as you are following your oath of office, you can also be faithful to the administration,' he testified.At the hearing, Rosenstein repeatedly declined to say whether Trump had ever asked him about the Russia Investigation. But he testified that he never received any 'improper orders' from Trump and denied that anyone ever asked him to pledge his loyalty, dating back to his time in the Bush administration.'Nobody has asked me to take a loyalty pledge, other than the oath of office,' Rosenstein said.In the first months of his presidency, Trump asked Comey for loyalty, according to Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill and his account to other FBI officials. Comey did not pledge loyalty, and after a few additional tense interactions with Trump, he was fired in May 2017.While searching for Comey's replacement, Trump interviewed acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Trump asked McCabe who he voted for during that interview, according to a source familiar with the matter. McCabe did not vote for president in the 2016 general election but did vote in the Republican primary in Virginia, sources told CNN. Trump has publicly denied that he asked McCabe who he voted for.Seven months later, Rosenstein made his pitch in the December meeting with the President, asking for White House backing as the Justice Department sought to deny access to sensitive documents demanded by Nunes, who has spent months pursuing claims of surveillance abuses by the FBI and the Justice Department against the Trump campaign.White House chief of staff John Kelly later notified the Justice Department that the President would not help block access to the documents.",
        "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Friday called the departure of his former staff secretary Rob Porter following allegations of domestic abuse  'very sad ' and said he wishes Porter  'well. 'The President, in his first public comments since Porter's resignation on Wednesday, did not express any sympathy for the women Porter allegedly abused -- instead pointing to Porter's claim that  'he's innocent. ' 'I found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, ' Trump said.  'We certainly wish him well. It's obviously a very tough time for him. He did a very good job while he was in the White House. 'Trump focused on Porter's denial of the allegations that he struck his two-ex-wives while they were married. 'He says he's innocent, and I think you have to remember that, ' Trump said.  'He said very strongly yesterday that he's innocent, but you'll have to talk to him about that. 'Trump's comments come as chief of staff John Kelly and other top White House officials are facing questions about why they did not act to remove Porter from his position after they found out about the allegations of domestic abuse.Senior aides knew for months about the allegations levied against Porter by his ex-wives, even as Porter's stock in the West Wing continued to rise, multiple sources have told CNN. Porter denied the allegations but resigned on Wednesday.Even after the allegations surfaced publicly, sources told CNN that Kelly did not urge Porter to resign or seek to force him out. Instead, the White House released a statement from Kelly praising Porter's character.It wasn't until the uproar over the allegations grew and more details surfaced that Porter resigned and Kelly put out a second statement expressing concern about the allegations.White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah acknowledged on Thursday the White House  'could have done better ' in its initial response to the allegations, a concession Trump was privately miffed about, CNN has learned.The allegations against Porter and the problematic internal response to the allegations -- which former senior staffers had known about for months -- has led to tensions inside the West Wing, with Kelly's credibility in particular coming under fire.Trump has also grown upset with his White House communications director Hope Hicks, who despite being in a romantic relationship with Porter helped craft the White House's initial pushback to the allegations, a source familiar said.",
        `Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he supports a government shutdown if Democrats won't agree to tighten immigration laws, undercutting ongoing bipartisan negotiations on Capitol Hill.The comment, which came during a White House meeting on the violent MS-13 gang, was not well received in the room. Rep. Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican who represents a district with thousands of federal workers, confronted Trump about the remark and urged him to avoid another government shutdown. 'If we don't change it, let's have a shutdown,' Trump said of the nation's immigration laws. 'We'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country. I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of.'He added: "If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety, and unrelated but still related, they don't want to take care of our military, then shut it down. We'll go with another shutdown."Several Republican aides working on the budget deal have voiced concern to CNN that the President's comments about a shutdown may cause things to fall apart.The issue is whether House Democrats -- who have for months been outright resistant to signing onto a budget agreement without a resolution on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- will now back away from the breakthrough deal negotiators are approaching.The President's remarks happened at the same time Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in separate news conferences, touted the progress on the talks and made clear a deal was close. The talks also separate the issue from immigration altogether -- long the GOP goal -- making the President's comments somewhat confusing."Things are in a good place, but also fragile," another GOP aide said, noting all of the moving parts in the talks. "We could do without anything inflammatory for a couple of days."Speaking shortly after Trump during the White House meeting, Comstock said she would not back such a move and urged Trump to avoid it."We don't need a government shutdown on this," she said. "I think both sides have learned that a government shutdown is bad."At a later event, Comstock described her comments with Trump as "a very civil discussion" and that she doesn't "support government shutdowns.When asked to clarify his remarks at the end of the roundtable, Trump told reporters again that he would shut down the government over immigration."I would shut it down over this issue. I can't speak for everybody at the table but I will tell you, I would shut it down over this issue," he said, adding that if the US doesn't straighten out its borders "we don't have a country. Without borders we don't have a country."Rep. Pete King, R-New York, who attended the White House meeting, told reporters afterward that he doesn't think the government will shutdown over immigration policy, despite Trump's comments.Though Trump opposed that government shutdown, he has previously said the United States could use a government work stoppage.CNN's Elizabeth Landers, Sunlen Serfaty and Donald Judd contributed to this report.`

        `It is a historic spectacle. Washington is transfixed by dueling “memos” between Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee over an FBI application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Carter Page of the Trump presidential campaign.The application included a 35-page “dossier” on Donald Trump prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele.The Washington press corps has kept the Trump-Russia collusion story before the American public for a year, and the president himself, speaking through his Twitter account, says he is the victim of a “witch hunt.”How did this spectacle happen? Two salient and related events occurred on Nov. 8, 2016. Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton for the U.S. presidency. Within hours, the Trump Panic went viral.The Trump Panic of 2016-17 was the belief that the U.S. presidency had fallen into the hands of an unacceptable person—who had to be stopped, or resisted by any means.Historians will record that the Trump Panic gripped all Democrats, some Republicans, scores of intellectuals (such as those who signed documents declaring their refusal to work in the Trump foreign-policy agencies), foreign leaders, journalists, and members of U.S. security agencies.On election day, two FBI officials— Peter Strzok of the bureau’s counterintelligence division and Lisa Page —exchanged text messages.Page: “OMG THIS IS F***ING TERRIFYING.” Strzok: “Omg, I am so depressed.”Recall how routine it was then to hear or read that the new U.S. president resembled Hitler or Mussolini. Democracy was “at risk”—even as such non-Hitlerian pillars as Jim Mattis, Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn joined the government.Let us stipulate it is not beyond imagining that individuals at the FBI’s Washington headquarters or at the Justice Department are Democrats. This is Washington, and the sky is blue. Historically, though, it has been possible to believe a functional distinction existed in these sensitive bureaucracies between political impulse and professional responsibility.Because of the Trump Panic, professional discipline eroded. Exhibit A will always be the Steele dossier. Spend 15 minutes reading it, and you will recognize a textbook example of the Russian Cold War art form of assembling published facts, half-truths, untruths and conspiracies into an eye-popping narrative that would embarrass Frederick Forsyth.From page 33: “Referring back to the (surprise) sacking of Sergei IVANOV as Head of PA in August 2016, his replacement by Anton VAINO and the appointment of former Russian premier Sergei KIRIYENKO to another senior position in the PA, the Kremlin insider repeated that this had been directly connected to the TRUMP support operation and the need to cover up now that it was being exposed by the USG and in the western media.”The Steele dossier is factoids on steroids. In normal times, the FBI would not include it in a submission to the FISA court. The Trump Panic wasn’t normal times. Decisions outside normal boundaries were considered justified.Recall Sally Yates. After President Trump’s legally vulnerable travel-ban order, acting Attorney General Yates wrote, “For as long as I am the acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of th[is] executive order.” You won’t what?By comparison, it is well known that during Barack Obama’s presidency, much of the U.S. military leadership abhorred his policies and directives. It is inconceivable that any of them would have refused to execute a similar order from Mr. Obama.But this was the Trump Panic, and Ms. Yates’s act of professional insubordination elicited approval in an email from Andrew Weissman, head of the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section: “I am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much.”This doesn’t mean the FBI is off the rails. It means a handful of people in Director James Comey’s orbit at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue—products of an insular, inbred Beltway village—lost their professional bearings and succumbed to the zeitgeist of panic over the Trump presidency. Righting that ship is crucial.We wrote at the outset that this is a spectacle. Which brings us, necessarily, to one of its ringmasters— Donald J. Trump.Controversies come and go for any presidency. Some, such as Watergate and Whitewater, kept going because it was possible to report events that truly advanced the story. The Russian collusion story went moribund months ago, with Rep. Adam Schiff reduced this week to waving the Steele dossier as if it were the second coming of the Pumpkin Papers, which revealed Alger Hiss as a Russian dupe.Anyone else in politics would have let the fires under the collusion issue burn down. Is it a potential legal problem? Sure. Should it be a destructive daily bonfire? No.Mr. Trump is combative not for political reasons but because he’s been combative all his life. In the Washington Swamp he has found the ultimate Trumpian arena. The Swamp is his sparring partner. Don’t let the raging tweets fool you. He loves it.`,
        `The Trump administration is backing a set of actions aimed at lowering prescription-drug costs, including a cap on the dollar amount that American seniors pay each year for expensive prescription drugs.The administration wasn’t specific about the dollar amount for the drug cap, and some of the proposals would require congressional action.Alex Azar, the newly confirmed Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the main objectives of the administration’s initiatives were to “reduce out-of-pocket expenses for seniors” and to “increase the ability of the government to get a good deal” in purchasing prescription drugs.“We do think drug prices are too high,” he said.Mr. Azar conducted a press briefing along with Mick Mulvaney, the White House’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, who described lower drug prices as “a top, top priority for the president.”The two senior Trump administration officials laid out a series of proposals that could lead to lower prescription-drug prices, but many of them were lacking in details. Some of the ideas are likely to be fleshed out further on Monday, when the administration is scheduled to release a budget proposal.The plans included making generic drugs available free for senior citizens in the Medicare program and increasing the ability of some state Medicaid programs to use their drug formularies—lists of approved drugs—to drive down the cost of prescription drugs in the state-federal program. That would be a five-state pilot program.It isn’t clear whether Congress would will tackle the proposals that require its approval. Drug-pricing experts, including those working for public-interest groups, generally reacted well to the ideas, but they were skeptical they would have a major impact on drug costs.“Some of these might be progress,” said Peter Maybarduk, the access-to-medicines director at Public Citizen in Washington. “But the savings are small compared to what they might be doing.”He suggested the administration would have a bigger impact by seeking to get direct drug-price negotiation power for the federal government in the Medicare program.A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of Medicare drug costs showed sharp increases in out-of-pocket costs for seniors over the 2011-2015 period. For example, patients paid $4,420 on average in 2015 for the cancer drug Gleevec, an 18% increase from 2011.“Drug prices are higher in the U.S. than in the rest of the industrialized world because, unlike that in nearly every other advanced nation, the U.S. health care system allows manufacturers to set their own price for a given product,” Harvard researchers wrote in JAMA in 2016. Researchers Aaron S. Kesselheim, Jerry Avorn and Ameet Sarpatwari said one solution is “providing greater opportunity for meaningful price negotiation by government payers.”“Right now, costs are a huge issue for people on expensive specialty drugs,” said Peter B. Bach, a drug-cost expert and director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.Dr. Bach said the administration needs to analyze drug companies’ costs more than it currently does. “Every other western country uses some form of analysis” of drug-research costs, he said.Some state officials think that “more limited” lists of approved drugs, or formularies, in their Medicaid programs could be used to “drive better bargains,” Mr. Azar said.He said the federal government is now seeking to approve more such state initiatives, such as one that was proposed recently by the Massachusetts Medicaid program.The administration also called for paying a markup of 3% instead of 6% in part of the federal Medicare program.Medicare in January slashed what it pays some hospitals for certain drugs under a program known as 340B. The move is expected by the Trump administration and health experts to reduce spending on drugs by Medicare enrollees, who pay some of the cost of certain medications. The American Hospital Association and other trade groups sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last year to halt the cuts, but a federal judge dismissed the case. Hospital groups have appealed the court’s decision.— Melanie Evans contributed to this article.Write to Thomas M. Burton at tom.burton@wsj.com`,
        `When President Donald Trump sends his annual budget to Congress next week, it will be largely obsolete because the big decisions on government tax and spending priorities have already been made on Capitol Hill.Last year’s White House budget proposed big cuts in spending programs including food stamps, disability benefits, welfare and student loans, totaling $4.5 trillion over a decade. In the process, it said, it would balance the budget in 10 years.But a lot has changed since then. In December, Republicans passed a tax cut that congressional scorekeepers estimate will increase the deficit by $1 trillion over a decade when accounting for its estimated effects on growth and revenue collections. Then this week, Republicans and Democrats agreed to a plan to break budget caps and spend $300 billion more than previously planned over the next two years.The Trump fiscal 2019 budget—due out on Monday—could again propose large cuts in domestic spending, an even larger boost in military spending and a balanced budget. But to get there, it would have to ignore the political dynamic that recently gave way to large spending increases and higher deficits.A White House budget is a window into an administration’s spending priorities and a regular Washington ritual that helps to set the tone of political debate between and within parties. In this case, said Steve Bell, a longtime Republican budget aide who is now a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, it “has no relevance to what’s going to happen next year in appropriations for fiscal year 2019.”A senior White House budget official on Friday said the president’s 2019 proposal would include an addendum reflecting the higher spending levels Congress set Friday. But the official acknowledged the underlying document—developed over several months—relies on outdated figures. The White House also plans to make recommendations for how Congress should allocate additional funds for the remainder of the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30The House and Senate narrowly approved legislation early Friday morning combining Congress’s budget agreement, which sets overall spending levels for the next two years, with a short-term spending bill to fund the government until March 23, ending a brief government shutdown. The agreement would also raise the government’s self-imposed ceiling on federal borrowing until March 1, 2019.The budget agreement gives congressional committees several weeks to write detailed spending bills. Those measures and the underlying agreement will dictate the direction of federal spending.Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, said Mr. Trump’s budget proposal could help lawmakers fill in some of the details as they write the full-year spending bill in coming weeks. The big issue of deciding how much the government will spend, however, has been largely set, he said.With Democratic and Republican leaders agreeing on a two-year spending plan, WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why the agreement, if it becomes law, could change the way Congress operates. Photo: GettyOther paths toward managing spending appear to be shut off. Mr. Trump said during his election campaign he didn’t want to cut the big entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said in December that entitlements were off limits in 2018.Cuts to other mandatory programs targeted in last year’s budget would be difficult to clear in the Senate without support from Democrats, which seems unlikely.The two-year budget agreement reached this week would increase domestic discretionary spending by about 9.6% from fiscal 2017, which ended last Sept. 30, compared with a roughly 10% decrease under the president’s 2018 budget. It would boost defense spending more than Mr. Trump proposed, to $700 billion this year compared with his $668 billion request, a roughly 10.4% increase from 2017, including emergency war spending.“The president seems to be cheerleading this budget agreement, so it will be a little strange if the president sends a budget request that doesn’t mirror what’s in an agreement that he’s openly advocating for,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.).Independent analysts say the new two-year agreement could boost deficits to $1 trillion by next year, at a time when the deficit as a share of gross domestic product is expected to rise and the economy is operating close to its full potential.Analysts also said Friday it reduced the odds of Congress pursuing a major infrastructure package this year, the one policy initiative Mr. Trump had hoped to advance in 2018.Congressional Republicans in the past have put forward budget resolutions that propose to eliminate the deficit over a decade. This year, House Republicans have discussed the possibility of skipping passage of a budget resolution for fiscal year 2019, since the Senate is unlikely to be able to pass one of its own.“Congress appears to be looking for every excuse to run away from the responsibilities of budgeting,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan nonprofit that advocates for deficit reduction. “They’ll politely nod at the president’s budget, and breathe a sigh of relief that they don’t have to put on paper something where the numbers would be very difficult to get to add up.”—Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com`,
        `Border agents say walls slow down people trying to make their way into the U.S. undetected. But local opposition to a new barrier is mobilizing, showing the challenge to building the structure even if Mr. Trump gets funding. Area politicians, business leaders, environmentalists and farmers call such walls destructive, expensive and ineffective. Last month, hundreds rallied in opposition next to the Santa Ana refuge.A 2017 photo of a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent passing along a section of border levee wall in Hidalgo, Texas.

That traps U.S. property between the wall and the river—including most of the 2,100 acres of the nature reserve. It’s a mecca for birdwatchers who flock to see both migrating and native species: the Green Jay, Peregrin falcons, five types of Kingbird and the seldom seen Crested Caracara.“Anyone who loves nature would be sad about this,” said Bonnie Hill, 65, a retired physician who was visiting the refuge in January from Minneapolis.“There are places they need a wall,” said Robert Draper, a volunteer at the center. “But this is a refuge.”Note: Due to the scale of the map, some gaps in the border fence may not be visible.Sources: Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting and OpenStreetMap contributors (border fence); Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s LandScan data (population density)Within the nature reserve is a levee—an elevated road with sloping dirt banks—-built to guard against floodwaters from the river. The administration wants to convert that into a 15- to 18-foot vertical span of concrete, topped by 18-foot high, tightly packed bollard fencing. Inside the Santa Ana, the levee wall would be yards from the visitor center, with nearly the entire refuge on the other side.That would mark the start of the administration’s quest to convert 60 miles of levees into walls across the Lower Rio Grande Valley, a vast, flat delta home to farmland, teeming towns and nature preserves. The most direct route through Mexico for migrating Central Americans, the valley is the busiest spot in the nation for illegal crossings, accounting for 15% of the southwest border land but 45% of apprehensions.Today, the Border Patrol guards the valley with 3,100 agents and 46 camera towers. Also in place: 55 miles of thick fencing, often topping concrete wall, but with large gaps.Mr. Padilla said he first wants more agents, followed by more technology. He put additional fencing as third priority. But he said he needs all three.“There’s no singular solution,” he said.Crude ladders found from migrants crossing near Hidalgo. Photo: Laura Meckler/The Wall Street JournalThe Border Patrol says existing fencing slows down many illegal crossers, who dash from the river through farmland, heavy brush and bramble, trying to make it to a road where smugglers can carry them away.“Once you cross the road, there are no cameras,” said border agent Robert Rodriguez.He pointed out an area in Hidalgo, a town west of the refuge, where the high fence tops a levee separating wooded river bottom from streets. Before the fence was put up about a decade ago, Mr. Rodriguez said, migrants could spring across the levee and disappear into a flea market. “It was a real, real hot spot,” he said.Created with Highcharts 6.0.4The Great FallThe push for funding for a wall on thesouthwest border comes after years of fallingapprehensions.The push for funding for a wall on the southwest border comes after years of falling apprehensions.Total border patrol apprehensions along theU.S.-Mexico borderTotal border patrol apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico borderSource: U.S. Customs and Border ProtectionNote: Fiscal years end Sept. 30Created with Highcharts 6.0.4.apprehensions20002005201020150250,000500,000750,0001,000,0001,250,0001,500,0001,750,000Still, about a dozen crudely made ladders lay piled nearby, underscoring one of the ways migrants overcome the fence. Mr. Rodriguez said agents had collected them in just a week.The nature reserve’s neighbors are uniting against the border-wall expansion. They don’t want a wall across their property and don’t want their homes or fields located behind it. The Bush administration was forced to file hundreds of eminent-domain lawsuits when it tried to take private land for fencing. It won most, but the suits delayed construction, sometimes for years.“It will split our farm in half and turn the area south of the wall into no man’s land,” said Frank Schuster, whose family has farmed thousands of acres of cotton, vegetable and sugar cane fields flanking the Santa Ana refuge for more than 70 years. “A technology-based fence with boots on the ground keeps the border at the river,” added Mr. Schuster, who voted for Mr. Trump.Created with Highcharts 6.0.4Who Is ApprehendedIn 2017, more than half the apprehensionswere families and children, who typically turnthemselves in to border agents in hopes ofstaying in the U.S.In 2017, more than half the apprehensions were families and children, who typically turn themselves in to border agents in hopes of staying in the U.S. Border patrol apprehensions in the RioGrande Valley sector of the U.S.-Mexicoborder.Border patrol apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector of the U.S.-Mexico border.Source: U.S. Customs and Border ProtectionNote: Fiscal years end Sept. 30Created with Highcharts 6.0.4.apprehensionsFamiliesUnaccompanied children20132014201520162017050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000Becky Schuster Jones, Mr. Schuster’s sister, traveled to Washington to lobby against the project.

People locked out of their own country,” she said.It was partly this sort of local opposition that blocked building in Texas during the Bush years.

That could be deadly to Santa Ana refuge animals, particularly the endangered ocelot, a small wildcat whose movement would be curtailed by a fence.“Nothing that walks or crawls gets over this, except people,” Mr. Nicol said, standing next to an existing levee fence at the nearby Old Hidalgo Pump House, upriver from the Santa Ana refuge.

        `President Trump sent a powerful early message of U.S. resolve last year when he bombed a Syrian air base after the Assad regime used sarin gas against civilians. He may need to send another because Syria has been testing his red line with multiple uses of chlorine gas in recent weeks.The State Department said this week that the United States is “gravely alarmed” by reports that the Syrian government has launched six chemical attacks against civilians over the past 30 days. Assad has dropped chlorine gas on his political opponents for years, but who’s going to stop him?In August 2012 Barack Obama warned of “enormous consequences” if Assad used chemical weapons, dubbing it a “red line.” The next year the dictator killed more than 1,400 people with sarin gas. Mr. Obama responded by signing a deal with Russia to seize Damascus’s chemical arsenal. Chlorine wasn’t included, and U.S. intelligence concluded Assad had retained some chemical stockpiles.Sure enough, the regime used sarin gas against civilians again last April, killing at least 85 people. Mr. Trump explained his missile launch in response as “in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.”But lately the Administration has turned, almost Obama-like, to pleading with Russia to make Assad stop his latest assaults. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson devoted a speech in January to the theme, noting that Moscow “pressed for, negotiated and agreed” to a September 2013 deal to destroy Syria’s “entire chemical weapons stockpile,” and supported a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution to hold chemical weapons users “to account.” Foggy Bottom repeated those pleadings on Monday and again on Thursday.Good luck with that. Last year Russia blocked the renewal of the U.N. panel that was established to investigate Syria’s chemical weapons. Russia now denies that Assad is using chlorine gas, and the U.N. panel isn’t around to document the truth.Moscow also hasn’t fulfilled a single agreement it has made with Mr. Trump. The Kremlin has failed to enforce a “deconfliction” zone in southwestern Syria as it promised to do as part of a 2017 U.S.-Russia agreement, and it is trying to negotiate its own settlement to the civil war outside of the U.N. process in Geneva it previously agreed to use. Moscow wants to keep Assad in power, maintain bases in Syria from which to threaten NATO, and thwart U.S. goals in the Middle East.Meanwhile, in a statement that echoes of Mr. Obama’s hashtag outrage, the State Department said Monday that “the people of Syria are suffering; the rest of the world is watching.” And doing nothing.Appeared in the February 9, 2018, print edition.`,

        `The Democrats’ immigration radicalism has handed Donald Trump a huge gift. The only question is whether he will smartly accept that gift by allowing them to walk away from the deal he has offered, rather than engage in pointless bargaining with a party that has no interest in strengthening America’s borders, focusing on higher-skilled immigrants, or even enforcing America’s existing immigration laws. Did I mention that further concessions to the Democrats on immigration will be electorally devastating, as they will drain all of the enthusiasm from Trump’s base?The president’s overly generous proposal on immigration, which provides an amnesty and pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal aliens who were brought to America as children in exchange for ending chain migration and the diversity visa lottery and beginning to fund a border wall, was greeted with predictable howls of indignation on the left. But while Nancy Pelosi and her media enablers may see Trump’s immigration framework as “an act of staggering cowardice which attempts to hold the Dreamers hostage to a hateful anti-immigrant scheme,” it is Pelosi and her Democratic brethren who are dangerously out of touch with American public opinion.While I personally favor a policy much tougher than the one espoused by the president, there is little doubt that Trump is correct when he notes that “the Republican position on immigration is the center mainstream view of the American people.”According to a recently-released Harvard-Harris Poll of registered voters, Trump’s framework encompasses the popular position on every major immigration issue. Democrats and open-borders Republicans are stuck with the political losers — and that’s likely even more true in the ten states that voted for Trump but have Democratic senators up for election in 2018. Amnesty for illegal aliens with no real border security or legal-immigration reform may gather a lot of sympathy in New York and California news rooms, but it is not going to win elections in Montana, West Virginia, or Missouri.Let’s remember that giving any amnesty at all to DACA recipients already marks a walk-back from a campaign promise. Trump promised to “immediately terminate” DACA in his announcement speech, a promise he repeated on several occasions during the campaign.But judging both from his comments on Twitter and from his remarks at the recent GOP congressional retreat, Trump appears to be pursuing a risky but potentially shrewd strategy on immigration: Offer Democrats a generous deal knowing that they will reject it, thus energizing Trump’s base, exposing the Democrats’ extremism, and helping the GOP going into the 2018 midterms. If that is indeed the poker game Trump is playing, there may well be a method to the madness of his amnesty offer.It bears repeating that it’s not Republican partisans who have shifted radically on immigration; it is the Democrats — with a particularly abrupt shift coming since 2012. About 80 percent of Republicans have long said they’re dissatisfied with current immigration levels, with 70 to 80 percent of the dissatisfied saying they’d like to see levels reduced, not increased. Democrats, by contrast, are increasingly likely to say the status quo is fine, and those dissatisfied are less and less likely to say they want immigration to fall. In this year’s Gallup poll on the question, half of respondents were satisfied with the way things are, and among the rest, just a quarter wanted to reduce immigration. With this shift the Democrats have become radically out of sync with public opinion in the rest of the country.The Harvard-Harris poll showed that while there was strong support for giving DACA recipients work permits and even a pathway to citizenship, 60 percent of Americans reject giving preference to parents and relatives of amnestied DACA recipients, including four out of five Republicans and two out of three independents — but only two out of five Democrats.Meanwhile, 80 percent of registered voters in that same survey rejected the premise of chain migration in favor of skills-based migration. Those numbers include 90 percent of Trump voters, 79 percent of independents, and incredibly even 72 percent of Democrats. An absolute majority, 63 percent (including 51 percent of Clinton voters!), want to admit fewer than 500,000 immigrants per year — last year we admitted 1.3 million — while only 12 percent want 1.5 million or more. Even a majority of Hispanics want annual immigration below 500,000, versus 8 percent who want 1.5 million or more.Meanwhile 83 percent of Trump voters and 58 percent of independents think border security is inadequate. And while Trump’s border wall has just 54 percent overall support, it was 89 percent among Trump voters and 54 percent among independents. The people who hate the wall aren’t voting for Trump anyway. Sixty-eight percent oppose the diversity visa lottery that Trump has proposed eliminating, including 76 percent of Trump voters and 65 percent of independents.In competitive states and districts in 2016, these numbers are doubtless even better. Pro-enforcement numbers in the Harvard-Harris poll were consistently stronger for these proposals in suburban areas (which constitute the vast majority of swing territory), while pro-amnesty numbers were inflated by large margins in urban areas with few competitive house seats. Likely voters tend to be more conservative than registered voters, further suggesting that Harvard-Harris underrates pro-enforcement sentiment.The polling numbers illustrate the central reality of the weakness of the Left’s immigration position. Its viability depends almost entirely on gauzy sob stories put forth by left-wing activists and the liberal media. The more we talk about the actual reality of U.S. immigration policy, the more we win. The more we talk about immigrants with skills we actually need, the more we win. The more voters are informed, the more we win.In the meantime, the GOP should be pressing ahead on all fronts — for example, dramatically speeding up the deportation process, rooting out the funding for far-left “refugee resettlement” agencies (most of which receive the vast majority of their funding from the federal government, and which regularly engage in political rallies to the adoration of the left-wing media), and putting pressure on lawless judges who have substituted their own personal views on immigration for U.S. lawThe GOP should also expand the immigration debate to include affirmative action and quotas: Under current legal precedents (which emphasize “diversity,” not historical oppression in the U.S.), as well as standard practice at many colleges and corporations, more than 90 percent of DACA recipients will immediately be eligible for racial preferences in education and hiring over approximately 90 percent of Trump’s voters. Republicans should ask how that helps Americans of any race.The informed conservative perspective on immigration continues to be: No amnesty — and if amnesty does become a necessary evil in an immigration deal, it must be sequenced after enforcement and legal changes have taken place and are shown to be effective.Right now the best thing for conservatives would be for Trump’s offer to fail and for the Democrats to pay for it at the ballot box in 2018. In the meantime, if the president stands firm on his offer, he is in a good place politically — he’s made the Democrats an offer they shouldn’t refuse — but in thrall to their radicalism, they probably will.`,
        `The case for the Trump presidencyAs President Trump finished his first full year in office, he could look back at an impressive record of achievement of a kind rarely attained by an incoming president — much less by one who arrived in office as a private-sector billionaire without either prior political office or military service. As unintended proof of his accomplishments, Trump’s many liberal opponents have gone from initially declaring him an incompetent to warning that he has become effective — insanely so — in overturning the Obama progressive agenda.Never Trump Republicans acknowledge that Trump has realized much of what they once only dreamed of — from tax reform and deregulation to a government about-face on climate change, the ending of the Obamacare individual mandate, and expansion of energy production.Trump so far has not enacted the Never Trump nightmare agenda. The U.S. is not leaving NATO. It is not colluding with Vladimir Putin, but maintaining sanctions against Russia and arming Ukrainians. It is not starting a tariff war with China. The administration is not appointing either liberals or incompetents to the federal courts.A politicized FBI, DOJ, and IRS was Obama’s legacy, not Trump’s doing, as some of the Never Trump circle predicted. Indeed, the Never Trump movement is now mostly calcified, as even some of its formerly staunch adherents concede. It was done in by the Trump record and the monotony of having to redefine a once-welcomed conservative agenda as suddenly unpalatable due to Trump’s crude fingerprints on it.On the short side, Trump has still not started to build his much-promised border wall, to insist on free but far fairer trade with Asia and Europe, or to enact an infrastructure-rebuilding program. Nonetheless, Trump’s multitude of critics is unable to argue that his record is shoddy and must instead insist that his list of achievements is due mostly to the Republican Congress. Or they claim he is beholden to the legacy of the Obama administration. Or they insist that credit belongs with his own impressive economic and national-security cabinet-level appointments. Or that whatever good came of Trump’s first year is nullified by Trump’s persistent personal odiousness.At the conclusion of Trump’s first year, the stock market and small-business confidence are at record highs, and consumer confidence has not been higher in 17 years. Trump’s loud campaign promises to lure back capital and industry to the heartland no longer look quixotic, given new tax and deregulatory incentives and far cheaper energy costs than in most of Europe and Japan.Trump has now ended 66 regulations for every one he has added. Few believed a Republican president could cut the corporate-tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent while capping state- and local-tax deductions for mostly high earners to $10,000. Those are the highlights of a comprehensive tax-reform and -reduction agenda that will likely accelerate the economy to an even more rapid growth rate than Trump’s first two full quarters of annualized increases in GDP of more than 3 percent.Dozens of large companies are already passing along some of their anticipated tax cuts to employees through increased wages or bonuses — dismissed as “crumbs” by House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Rising workers’ wages and anticipated tax credits and savings for the lower and middle classes for now are rendering almost mute the age-old fights about state-mandated minimum-wage laws. The mostly unheralded nixing of the Obamacare individual mandate — once the great ideological battlefield of the Affordable Care Act — will insidiously recalibrate the ACA into a mostly private-market enterprise.Domestic oil production is slated to exceed 2017 record levels and soon may hit an astonishing 11 million barrels a day. “Peak oil” for now is an ossified idea, as are massive wind and solar Solyndra-like government subsidies and the mostly unworkable Paris Climate Accord.Gas, oil, and coal production are expected to rise even higher with new Trump initiatives to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge field in Alaska, encourage more fracking on federal lands and offshore, and complete needed pipeline links while encouraging coal exportation.For all the political horse-trading over extending or ending the Obama executive orders on DACA, illegal immigration has declined according to some metrics by over 60 percent. It is now at the lowest levels in the 21st century — even before the ending of chain migration and enacting of new border-security initiatives.For all the political horse-trading over extending or ending the Obama executive orders on DACA, illegal immigration has declined according to some metrics by over 60 percent.Abroad, the ISIS caliphate is for all purposes now extinct. Its demise is in part due to Trump’s outsourcing of the conflict to Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who liberated ground commanders from Obama-administration-era legalistic rules of engagement. Trump’s appointees, such as Mattis, National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have worked in concert to restore U.S. deterrence. Variously called “principled realism” or a new “Jacksonianism,” the Trump doctrine has now replaced the “strategic patience” and “lead from behind” recessionals of the prior administration and not emulated the neoconservative nation-building of the George W. Bush administration.New pressures on nuclear North Korea have prompted the toughest U.N. trade sanctions in history on the rogue state. After Trump’s fiery and erratic rhetoric and muscular displays of U.S. naval and air power in the Pacific, Pyongyang has agreed to landmark talks with Seoul. China is slowly beginning to pressure North Korea to stop launching missiles. Beijing’s Asian neighbors are beefing up missile defense and growing closer to the U.S. For now, the bad cop Trump and the good cops Mattis and McMaster have encouraged friends and frightened enemies, although the shelf life of such diplomatic gymnastics is limited.Trump almost immediately voiced support for mass demonstrations in Iran, in a manner Obama failed to do in 2009. An ironic fallout of the disastrous 2015 Iran deal may be that the theocracy so hyped its cash windfalls from American relaxation of embargoes and sanctions that it inadvertently raised Iranians’ expectations of a rise in the standard of living. Then it dashed just those hopes by squandering hundreds of millions of newfound dollars in subsidizing Hezbollah, conducting a costly expeditionary war to save the genocidal Bashar al-Assad regime, and likely continuing an exorbitantly costly nuclear-weapons program.What is different about Iran’s internal unrest this time around is twofold. The Trump administration is not invested in any “landmark” deal with Tehran that requires ignoring protesters in the street. Trump also does not envision revolutionary and terror-sponsoring Iran as a “very successful regional power” with “legitimate defense concerns.” Rather, he sees Tehran, along with ISIS and al-Qaeda, as the chief source of Middle East unrest and anti-Americanism.Moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, in line with past congressional mandates, along with threatening to curtail Palestinian aid, only reifies what is now widely accepted. The new Middle East is not the old. There are no longer any ongoing and viable “peace plans,” “road maps,” or “summits.” America is becoming energy-independent and immune to oil boycotts. There are new and greater threats than Israel to Arab regimes, from nuclear Iran to the scourge of Islamic terrorism in Iraq and Syria. Patience is wearing thin as after 30 years the Palestinians still cannot create transparent and consensual government. Seventy years after the birth of Israel, the Palestinians still insist on being called “refugees” — when most of the world’s millions of displaced persons decades ago moved on.Yet as Trump heads into the 2018 midterms, his favorability ratings are unimpressive. Because of loud Democratic threats of using impeachment proceedings to undermine the Trump project, the 2018 fight for the House is taking on historic importance. It is not just a referendum on the Trump agenda, but likely a means to seek to discredit or remove Trump himself — even if the prosecution in the Senate would likely never find the necessary 67 votes.In sum, an embattled Trump now finds himself in a war on all fronts.The first and most important conflict is one of favorability. Trump’s actual approval ratings, as in 2016, are probably somewhat higher than the low 40s reported in many polls. But Trump’s image is still astonishingly dismal in relation to his unappreciated achievements. For congressional Republicans to survive the midterms and retain majorities, Trump perhaps has to hope that the economy will grow not just at 3 percent but even more robustly — with marked rises in workers’ take-home wages due to tax cuts and labor shortages.Is it really true that politics can be reduced to “It’s the economy, stupid”? Obama failed to achieve 3 percent growth per annum over his eight years. As a result he may have lost both houses of Congress, but he also was reelected. More likely, no one quite knows the exact political consequences of economic growth. Between November 1983 and November 1984, the economy grew at 7 percent and ipso facto ushered the once “amiable dunce” Ronald Reagan into a landslide reelection victory over a previously thought-to-be-far-more-impressive Walter Mondale. Yet this time it may be that 3 percent GDP growth will not mitigate Trump’s personal negatives but 4–5 percent would.It is said that Trump is also at war with himself, in the sense that his tweeting alienates the key constituencies of women voters and independents. Conventional wisdom assures that Trump’s off-the-cuff invectives only fuel his critics and overshadow his achievements. In the heart of immigration negotiations, Trump was quoted secondhand as having called Haiti and other formerly Third World countries “sh**hole” countries and thus undesirable sources of mass immigration to the U.S. Whatever the reliability of reports of the slur, Trump is certainly not the sort of politician to have said instead, “It would seem wiser to encourage diverse immigration, including immigration from the most developed countries as well as the least developed” — even as many people privately agree with Trump’s earthy assessment that immigration should be far more selective and include a far greater variety of countries of origin.Both Trump’s spoken and electronic stream-of-consciousness venting can be unorthodox, crude and cruel, and often extraneous. But can anyone measure whether and to what degree his Twitter account energizes and widens his base more than it loses him supporters otherwise sympathetic to his agenda? The orthodox wisdom is that Trump should let his achievements speak for themselves, curb his raucous campaign rallies, and restrict his daily tweets to expansions on his agenda and achievement and leave the feuding to subordinates.When Trump has avoided ad hominem spats, and been filmed conducting policy sessions with his cabinet and congressional enemies and friends, he has looked and acted “presidential.” How good then must Trump’s record become to overshadow both the prejudices against him and his own inner demons to achieve favorability ratings that will provide coattails for his congressional supporters and fuel an even more ambitious second-year agenda? Again, time is running out, and in the next ten months the economy must boom as never before or Trump must learn to sound more like a Ronald Reagan than a Howard Stern.Trump is simultaneously at war with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Once again, the critical element is time in the sense of the looming midterm elections. So far, after months of media speculation and press leaks, there is no evidence of Russian–Trump collusion. Robert Mueller’s investigative team has been riddled by charges of conflicts of interest, workplace unprofessionalism, and political bias.The basis of the entire writ against Trump, the Fusion GPS–Steele dossier, is now mostly discredited. The file’s lurid sexual accusations alone likely won it notoriety in 2016 among journalists and Obama-administration enablers. The more that is learned about the Steele opposition-research file — paid for by the Clinton campaign, polluted by Russian rumor-mongering, peddled to the FBI, manipulated by the Obama administration to justify FISA surveillance, likely leaked to pet reporters by Obama-administration and Clinton-campaign officials — the more apparent it may become that Mueller is investigating Russian collusion in entirely the wrong place.Another irony is that pushback against the Mueller fishing expedition may prompt reinvestigations into the earlier election-cycle-aborted inquiries about Clinton email improprieties. The Obama administration also likely acted improperly in ignoring the Clinton–Uranium One connections and Hillary Clinton’s violations of agreements with the Obama administration to report the sources of all private donations to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure. So far resistance at both the Department of Justice and the FBI to releasing documents pertaining to all these avenues of interest has stymied House and Senate inquiries.If the Republicans lose the Congress, these investigations will shut down entirely. Democratic majorities will give Mueller a free hand to do as he pleases without worries about past complaints over the ethical shortcomings of his investigation. Select Intelligence and Judiciary Committee hearings will likely give way in the House to impeachment proceedings.But if within the next nine months there are new explosive revelations about the improper or even illegal uses of the Steele dossier and the Clinton scandals, while the Mueller team settles for face-saving indictments of former Trump subordinates for transgressions that have little to do with the original Mueller mandate to investigate Russian–Trump collusion, then Trump will win the legal war. In that case, Trump finally will not only weather the collusion crisis but find himself a political beneficiary of one of the most scandalous efforts to subvert a political campaign and improperly surveil American citizens in recent American history.Trump wages a fourth war against the proverbial mainstream media, whose coverage, according to disinterested analyses, runs over 90 percent anti-Trump. Negative Trump news fuels Trump-assassination chic in popular culture, the rants of late-night-television comedians, the political effort to grandstand with impeachment writs, calls to invoke the 25th Amendment, and lawsuits alleging violations of the emoluments clause. The threats of a Madonna, the raving of Representative Maxine Waters, the boasts of the “Resistance,” the efforts of blue states to nullify federal immigration law or to dodge compliance with unwelcome new federal tax statutes, and the conspiracy fables of Representative Adam Schiff are all fueled by media attention and preconceived narratives hostile to Trump. The anti-Trump news is still determined to accomplish what so far the Clinton campaign, Obama holdovers, and deep-state bureaucrats have not: so discredit Trump the messenger that his message becomes irrelevant.Trump apparently fights his war against the media in the fashion in which toxic chemotherapy battles cancer. His personal and electronic rants against “fake news” and “crooked” journalists are intended to exhibit media biases and thus discredit negative coverage just before the public tires of Trump’s own off-putting venom.On the one hand, Trump’s anemic approval ratings might suggest the media are winning in their 24/7 efforts to portray Trump as a Russian colluder, rank profiteer, distracted golfer, tax cheat, sexual predator, trigger-happy warmonger, or senile septuagenarian.On the other hand, the media are polling worse than Trump. And his battle has nearly destroyed the credibility of CNN, which has fired marquee journalists for false anti-Trump narratives, been embarrassed by hosts mouthing scatological venom, suffered employees’ hot-mic wishes for Trump’s death, and seen its anchors and special correspondents reduced to on-air rants. For now, no one knows whether Trump’s war against the media is pyrrhic, in that he may defeat his journalist enemies and even render their entire networks discredited, but at such costs that he is no longer politically viable.For all the animus against Trump the person, his agenda — tax cuts, deterrence, reindustrialization, middle-class job growth, closing the borders, the melting pot — is increasingly polling well.Trump is waging a fifth and final war against Democrats. So far Trump has sucked all the oxygen out of the Democratic atmosphere. Politicians and operatives are so obsessed with proving Trump a liar, a cheat, a pervert, a con artist, or an incompetent that they have offered so far no viable opposition leader or alternative agenda. But will just being not-Trump make Democrats preferable?The centrist Democratic party of the 1990s no longer exists. It has become instead a coalition of patched-together progressive causes. The redistributionism and neo-socialism of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are now Democratic economic mainstays. Barack Obama’s lead-from-behind legacy remains Democratic foreign policy. Identity politics still constitutes the culture of the party establishment.In more practical terms, for all the animus against Trump the person, his agenda — tax cuts, deterrence, reindustrialization, middle-class job growth, closing the borders, the melting pot — is increasingly polling well. In many cases, Trumpism is more popular than Democratic signature issues such as tax hikes, larger government, more entitlements, open borders, more identity politics, and European Union–like internationalism.The idea of Oprah Winfrey as the 2020 Democratic nominee and the unwillingness of Democrats to secure the border reveal what can happen when a party is reduced to defining itself as not being the incumbent president. The Republicans learned that lesson in their four-time failure to defeat the hated Roosevelt. Democrats in the 1980s had little to offer the country other than not being the supposed buffoon Ronald Reagan. Shutting down the government is also rarely a winning strategy for an out party — as the Republicans learned in their politically disastrous 1995–96 showdown with Bill Clinton.In 2018, it may be enough for congressional candidates to run on anti-Trump invective without expressing strong views on the issues or identifying with any particular national leader. But it won’t be so in 2020, especially if the Trump agenda grows more popular and Trump allows it rather than himself to become his signature message.For now, all that is certain about Trump’s first year is the 2016 truism that past prognostications and current polls are irrelevant. The jester candidate, Donald Trump, destroyed, not just beat, his 16 primary rivals. The doomed candidate Trump defeated the most well-financed, experienced, and media-favored Democratic candidate in memory. The inept President Trump’s first year was not liberal or directionless, but marked the most successful and conservative governance since Ronald Reagan’s.Trump’s critics insist that his comeuppance is on the horizon. They assure us that character is destiny. Trump’s supposed hubris will finally earn an appropriately occasioned nemesis. But in the meantime, nearly half the country may be happy that the establishment was not just wrong but nearly discredited in its non-ending, prejudicial dismissal of the Trump agenda and, so far, the successful Trump presidency.`,
        `as the FBI out to get candidate Donald Trump?That’s the big question emerging from the much-ballyhooed memo from Representative Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Nunes’s memo focuses on the application for a FISA warrant against former Trump foreign-policy aide Carter Page; the application supposedly relied heavily on the Hillary Clinton–funded Fusion GPS dossier compiled by British spy Christopher Steele. That dossier was filled with unverified information. According to Nunes, top actors at the FBI knew all of this and used the dossier as the basis for the application — all without informing the FISA court that the dossier was a political document.Now, the memo admits that the Trump–Russia collusion investigation didn’t begin with the Page FISA application — it began, instead, with an investigation into former Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, who has now pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Furthermore, Page is a longtime target for the FBI, which began monitoring him in 2014, thanks to his extensive connections to the Russian government.But the case seems to be this: Fusion GPS funneled its dossier to the FBI; the FBI’s top officials, including director James Comey, worked with the DOJ, led by attorney general Loretta Lynch and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, to attain the FISA warrant based on the shoddy Steele information. This is evidence that the “deep state” wanted to get Trump, and that the same “deep state” wants to take Trump out now via the Mueller investigation.It may well be true that the FISA application on Page was fatally flawed and driven by prosecutorial aggression. But in order for the most conspiratorial “deep state” claims to be true, a few other things have to be true. First, we have to assume there’s no there there: that the FBI had no reasonable grounds for suspicion regarding the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Second, we have to assume that the entire Steele dossier is pure garbage, and that all parts of it remain unverified. Third, we have to assume that the FBI’s attempts to get a warrant against Page were driven by anti-Trump bias, not by serious suspicions about Page. Fourth, we have to assume that all of this wasn’t bureaucratic incompetence, but malice. Finally, we have to assume that the same supposedly bad actors within the FBI and DOJ are now staffing the Mueller investigation, or at least that their legacy continues through Mueller.All of these claims seem weak. First, we know that Donald Trump Jr. met at Trump Tower with top campaign officials and a Russian-government-connected lawyer — and that he’d written in emails that he was looking for dirt on Hillary, and was willing to accept help from the Russian government. We also know that Papadopoulos was snooping for information from the Russian government. There was likely no campaign collusion with Russia, but to suggest that there were no reasonable grounds for suspicion is a separate claim.Second, we know that large portions of the Steele dossier were garbage. We don’t know that the FBI knew that the entire Steele dossier was garbage; as Comey testified, he knew portions were “salacious and unverified,” but he never testified that every element of the document was false. That doesn’t mean the FBI should have used the dossier as the basis for a warrant. But it does mean that accusing FBI officials of buying into the dossier wholesale may not be correct.We know that large portions of the Steele dossier were garbage. We don’t know that the FBI knew that the entire Steele dossier was garbage.Third, Page was a deeply suspicious character. That still may not justify the independent warrant from 2016, as Andrew McCarthy points out, but it does justify the FBI’s suspicions regarding Page. Page has a long and nefarious history with Russia: In his early career, he advised Gazprom, the Russian official oil company; in 2013, the Russians attempted to cultivate Page as an intelligence source and stated in intercepted communications that “it’s obvious he wants to earn loads of money”; a FISA warrant was obtained against Page in 2014; that same year, he wrote in favor of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. Finally, in 2016, he became a Trump foreign-policy advisor.Fourth, it’s possible that serious suspicions about Page, combined with suspicions about Papadopoulos, led the FBI and DOJ to cut corners. That’s not quite the same thing as the FBI and DOJ deciding to “get Trump” and then backtracking to Papadopoulos and Page. This could be prosecutorial overreach and incompetence. The FBI texts between agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page cut in favor of the bias theory, of course — but then again, Strzok did state that he didn’t see any evidence of actual collusion by 2017 in those same texts.Finally, the notion that Mueller is somehow responsible for any of this — when he fired Strzok and Page, and when he had nothing to do with the FISA application on Page — is a stretch. That’s why Republicans from Representative Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) have disclaimed any such connection, and have stood up for the continuation of the probe without interference.There is a serious problem inside the FBI and the DOJ with regard to the Hillary Clinton investigation. We know this. There may be a serious problem with the FISA process; that problem may have affected the Page application. But we should be careful about the conclusions we draw from the evidence we currently have. If we aren’t careful, we’ll end up not just mischaracterizing events, but smearing clean FBI agents and destroying the basis for the FISA process as well.`,

        `President Donald Trump has not acknowledged June 1, 2017 as the beginning of LGBTQ Pride month, missing an opportunity to be the first Republican president to publicly recognize the annual month dedicated to the queer community.Trump, who was heralded by Log Cabin Republicans as “the most gay-friendly Republican nominee for president ever,” had remained mum on the issue as of Thursday afternoon.President Bill Clinton was the first president to publicly recognize June as LGBTQ Pride month in 2000, issuing a proclamation that read in part:This June, recognizing the joys and sorrows that the gay and lesbian movement has witnessed and the work that remains to be done, we observe Gay and Lesbian Pride Month and celebrate the progress we have made in creating a society more inclusive and accepting of gays and lesbians.President Barack Obama also declared June LGBTQ Pride month, throughout the course of his Presidency, with the proclamation typically sent out a day before the month began. He issued a proclamation every year of his presidency ― eight in total.Throughout the course of his campaign, Trump boasted that he was a friend of the LGBTQ community, even bizarrely holding a rainbow flag upside down at one campaign event. However, his cabinet, including the vehemently anti-gay Vice President Mike Pence, is heavily stacked with people opposed to the rights of queer people.This year, many Pride celebrations are being rebranded as protests and “resistance marches” due to fears about how the Trump administration’s actions could affect the queer community, as well as those with other marginalized identities, including women, people of color and immigrants.This Pride month remains a particular tender time for the LGBTQ community, with June 12 marking the one year anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub Massacre.The Washington Blade noted on Thursday that Trump issued five different proclamations on May 31 recognizing June as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, African-American Music Appreciation Month, National Homeownership Month, Great Outdoors Month and National Ocean Month — but did not release anything related to Pride.HuffPost reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back.`,
        `Justin Trudeau seemed firmly committed to be the dreamiest ― and queer-friendliest ― public leader in the north-western hemisphere on Sunday.He then marched in the Toronto Pride Parade, along with his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and their children Xavier and Ella-Grace.Trudeau, who was decked out in Ramadan-themed socks which read “Eid Mubarak” and wore a rainbow maple leaf on his cheek, spoke to reporters before the parade began about his presence at the annual event.“We celebrate the multiple layers of identities that make Canada extraordinary and strong and today we celebrate with the entire LGBTQ community,” he said.Trudeau also tweeted out photos from the parade with the caption “Love is love”:Earlier this month Trudeau celebrated Pride in Canada with a ceremony that included raising the rainbow flag and transgender flag above the country’s parliament building. He also promised to introduce legislation later this year that would “acknowledge and apologise for the historical discrimination” LGBTQ Canadians have faced in the past.“I believe that it’s essential to make amends for past wrongs, and not to simply gloss over them,” Trudeau said. “Our government believes in equality and equal treatment for all Canadians. We will passionately defend the rights of all our citizens regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.”Trudeau’s American counterpart, President Donald Trump, on the other hand, neglected to offer an official proclamation designating June as Pride Month in the United States. This is the first time in eight years that no such proclamation has been offered. Trump did offer six other proclamations for June, including “National Homeownership Month” and ”National Ocean Month.”This month also marks the first time in over two decades that the White House did not host an iftar dinner, the meal Muslims eat to break their daily fast during Ramadan.Below, check out more photos of Trudeau looking adorable and affirming at Toronto Pride.`,
        `The LGBTQ community had the chance to party with the Massachusetts senator at the event, where she took selfies and delivered hugs. Warren posted photos and a video to both her official government Facebook page and her personal page.“I love Pride,” Warren said in her video. “It may be my single most favorite day of the year. Because it’s the day we all come together to celebrate love.”Heck yes, senator!Warren is a politician with more than just talk. She has been an advocate in fighting against conversion therapy and challenging appointed figures who turn a blind eye to the discrimination of queer youth.And she parties with the best of them.“I don’t march in the Boston Pride Parade,” she wrote in another post. “I dance.”Check out Warren’s day at the parade in the photos below.`,

      `Logan Paul has returned to YouTube with a video about his own redemption story. Logan Paul speaks at the Teen Choice Awards in Los Angeles in August. YouTube has suspended the star, who posted video images of what appeared to be a suicide victim, but said on Jan. 13 it still might work with him in the future. (Phil McCarten/Invision/AP)Logan Paul’s return to YouTube was inevitable. Sure, he had vlogged the dead body of a suicide victim, a video that grotesquely proved the troubling thesis about YouTube culture that everything, eventually, can and will become someone’s viral content.Three weeks after apologizing for the video, losing his access to YouTube’s premium ad program and seeing his future projects with YouTube’s subscription service put on hold, Paul posted a new video on his vlogging channel on Wednesday, which has 16 million subscribers. It’s called: “Suicide: Be Here Tomorrow.”[Earlier: YouTube promised ‘consequences’ after Logan Paul vlogged a dead body. Here they are.]The tone of Paul’s vlogs are normally that of a frat boy with a new puppy. His newest video, like his other videos, focuses squarely on Paul’s thoughts, experiences and feelings, but that is where the similarities end. Instead Paul has made a documentary of what he believes is his own redemption story.Paul has also pledged $1 million to various suicide prevention groups, with $250,000 of that going to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. When Paul found a dead body in a Japanese suicide forest, he called the resulting video “the most real vlog I have ever posted on this channel” and “a moment in YouTube history.” The vlog’s thumbnail contained a partially blurred image of the body hanging from a tree. Paul and his gang documented their reactions to seeing a dead body for the first time. The camera zoomed in on the dead body’s hands, on its back pocket, flipping back repeatedly to document Paul’s shocked face. At one point, Paul paused to tell his young audience suicide was bad. He said his intention was to “raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention.”Paul’s redemption video is a documentation of Paul learning why his suicide video was so wrong, by doing the work he should have done in the first place.The video begins not with Paul’s voice, but that of Kevin Hines, a suicide activist and survivor, talking about how he survived jumping over the Golden Gate Bridge when he was 19.“I’m standing at the ledge, leaning over the rail with tears flowing down to the waters, and I thought to myself, absolutely nobody cares. And the voice in my head said, ‘Jump now,’ and I did. And the millisecond my hands cleared the rail and my legs flew over it, it was an instant regret. The depression was wiped from my mind, and all I wanted to do was live, and I thought it was too late.” As Hines speaks, Paul sits, listening intently.Then, the video turns to Paul. In a voice-over, Paul says, “I know I’ve made mistakes. I know I’ve let people down. But what happens when you’re given an opportunity to help make a difference in the world?”Paul then meets with Bob Forrest of Alo House Malibu Rehab. Forrest seems surprised when Paul says he did not know anyone who had committed suicide, considering he is from Ohio, where suicide is a leading cause of death.Paul responds, “That was part of the problem, was just my ignorance on the subject.”Saying he “wants to be part of the solution,” Paul then goes to New York to meet with Dr. John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.Draper says, “We have to change the conversation publicly from just focusing on suicide and how something bad is happening and say, “What do we do about it?” Again, Paul listens. Draper tells Paul five steps for helping to prevent suicide, which Paul then shares with his viewers.The vlogger’s return was teased for days by Paul’s immediate family, who all also run their own vlogging channels. Paul’s equally famous brother Jake Paul discussed his brother’s suicide video for the first time earlier this week in one of his daily vlogs.[Jake Paul doesn’t need Disney. YouTube already gives him an army.]“I know Logan more than probably anybody else. I do know though that he did not mean to offend anyone,” Paul said. Later, he told Logan’s fans — who refer to themselves as the “Logang” — he was positive his brother was “going to learn from his mistakes .?.?. and be able to bounce back.” Their father, Greg Paul, told the Logang in an Instagram video “get your vlog belts on” because “some things are coming atcha that you’ve been waiting for.” Outside of the Paul expanded universe, the question about Logan’s return has been: Will the vlogger ever be able to recover from a scandal this big? In many ways, that is the wrong question. YouTuber Philip DeFranco tweeted why immediately after Logan found himself in trouble:“Before all the extended community outrage against Logan Paul’s ‘we found a dead body’ video, there was a seemingly uncontested 550-600,000 likes on it,” DeFranco wrote. His “core audience” doesn’t care, he said, “unless YouTube does something, this doesn’t hurt him.”YouTube did act, eventually, releasing a statement condemning Paul’s video one week after it first went live, taking measures to penalize Paul’s channel financially, and to prevent similar international YouTube scandals. Paul might not earn as much money as he did before from his vlogging lifestyle, but the fact remains he still has his audience. His subscriber count has even grown. Paul will keep his audience for as long as his young fans still find his life interesting enough to watch his vlogs and buy his merch.`
      `Jake Adelstein has been an investigative journalist in Japan since 1993, writing in both Japanese and English, and he is the co-author of “Pay the Devil in Bitcoin: The Creation of a Cryptocurrency and How Half a Billion Dollars of It Vanished from Japan.”New Year’s Eve is an important day in Japan. It ends with the ringing of a temple bell around midnight. The bell is rung 108 times to banish the sins, mistakes and sufferings of the previous year. However, for one YouTuber, Dec. 31 may haunt him long past the new year. That was the day Logan Paul posted a video of himself walking through Aoikigahara in Yamanashi Prefecture, also known as “the suicide forest.” The clip shows him appearing to discover a dead body. He is later seen laughing in the video, which raised the ire of many both in and outside Japan.Let me say, I’m not outraged. As someone who’s been reporting on Japan’s suicide issues since 1993, I think he deserves some credit.The YouTuber has since apologized profusely, stating that he wished to call attention to Japan’s suicide problem. Japan definitely has one — in all walks of life. For years, the number of suicides has persistently floated around 30,000 annually. In 2012, Tadahiro Matsushita, the minister of financial services, reportedly hung himself in his home on World Suicide Prevention Day. It was reported that he was struggling with the pressures of his job.Logan Paul apologized on Jan. 2 for posting a video of a man who had apparently killed himself in a forest in Japan. (Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)The problem is closely linked to a work culture where karojisatsu — suicide caused by overwork — is not uncommon. In 2016, when the Ministry of Labor recognized the suicide of a young female employee of Japan’s prestigious advertising firm Dentsu as the tragic result of overwork, it sent a shock wave through the business world.She had committed suicide on Christmas Day in 2015 by jumping from a corporate dormitory. She had worked 100 hours of overtime the month before. She tweeted that year, “When you’re in the office 20 hours a day, you don’t understand what life you’re living for anymore. It’s so pathetic … you come to laugh.” Unfortunately, the Japanese government’s approach to the problem – a cap of 100 hours of overtime working hours per month – is tragically inadequate. That cynical solution, from the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is more horrifying than any corpse.Let’s talk about Aokigahara a bit more. Also known the Sea of Trees, it’s a maze-like forest on the northwestern side of Japan’s Mount Fuji that has been a suicide hot spot since the 1960s. There are others.It was also recommended in the 1993 bestseller, “The Complete Manual of Suicide,” by Wataru Tsurumi.I remember the book well. I had just started working as a reporter on the police beat that year. A teenage boy was found dead with a copy next to him. He’d electrocuted himself as shown in the book, but not before posting a sign on himself, “Do not touch me. Danger.”The cop who gave me the story wanted me to warn parents to talk to their children if they saw the book.It was my first scoop and a sobering introduction to Japan’s culture of suicide.When there was another book-related death, we elected not to run the story. We feared that by promoting the book we might be prompting people to kill themselves.Years later my mentor at the newspaper killed herself after being exiled from the news department. We were all ordered not to talk about the case with other media. There was no internal “suicide awareness seminar” or discussion.I’m a reporter still, but I’m also a newbie Zen Buddhist priest. This year I participated in O-segaki, a ceremony held in the summer, to help the spirits of those trapped between life and death — “hungry ghosts” — pass on to the next incarnation. Suicide is both glorified and treated with horror in Japan, where there is still a belief that those who kill themselves are trapped in limbo.I’m now learning to talk to people about reasons to live and how to console those who are left behind.I can understand the criticism of Paul. The video wasn’t tasteful, but if it has focused attention on Japan’s suicide problem, then there may be some good to come out of it.It is also true that when you give attention to places where people commit suicide, you risk encouraging people to go to them. Residents in other areas have to deal with “suicide tourism.”The majestic cliffs known as Tojinbo, another hot spot for those seeking to throw themselves to their deaths, saw a real drop in suicides after Pokemon Go was released in 2016 and the area was temporarily besieged with Pokemon hunters. That was luck. There is also a retired Japanese police detective who patrols the area and has saved hundreds of people. Local citizens have posted suicide prevention hotline numbers, set up better illumination, organized volunteer patrols and even used drones to find people on the edge.If Logan Paul really wants to send a message about preventing suicide and possibly atone for an error in judgement, he should visit Tojinbo and talk to the locals. I’d be happy to go with him.`
      `In a video to his 10 million YouTube subscribers Tuesday, Jake Paul laid out his plan: He was going to Houston to save it from Harvey. “I need your guys’ help. I need your power. I need your commitment. We have the chance to save thousands of lives and to show the world the power of social media.” The video was dramatically titled, “This might have to be my last vlog…”“This is extra special to me,” he said in the video. “Because there could be Jake Paulers that are devastated by this.”Paul and “Uncle Kade,” a member of his crew of aspiring social media influencers, stood in front of a white pickup truck loaded with gear and supplies for their 22-hour drive to Houston. Paul seemed amped, pacing and shouting interjections (“They’re dying!”) as he and Kade explained to their viewers that they wanted to help. They also wanted to let people know that their trip wasn’t about vlogging (that’s video blogging, for the olds among us), even though Paul is famous for vlogging daily about, essentially, having a massively successful vlog.The Houston trip was also about vlogging, however. It can’t be anything else for Paul, who has turned “It’s everyday bro” into his mantra. The “everyday” means that he vlogs every day of his life. If Paul was going to Houston, so were his cameras. As the excitement built, Paul told his fans, “We are gonna get them supplies, we are gonna save their lives, and we’re gonna flippin’ vlog it all at the same time!”“We’re gonna flippin’ rise, and we’re gonna everyday-bro it, in their face,” Paul said at another point. It wasn’t clear whether he was talking about Harvey or his haters. Maybe it was both.Paul, 20, became famous on the now-defunct social media platform Vine, and then even more famous on YouTube this year, propelled by the devotion of an army of young teens, the “Jake Paulers.”Most people over the age of 15 probably had no idea who Paul was until this summer, when a local news station reported on the nightmare he was creating for his neighbors. Hordes of 12-year-olds waited outside his home every day for a glimpse of their favorite star; the stunts and pranks he engineered for his vlog were meant for a movie set, not a residential neighborhood. Paul lost his role on a Disney Channel show during the ensuing fallout — the company’s kid-friendly brand doesn’t like the burning of furniture.Over the past few months, Paul has weaponized the drama that surrounds him. He and older brother Logan (also an extremely famous YouTuber) “fight” and reconcile endlessly in vlogs, pranks and dis tracks. Their fans don’t care whether the rivalry has all the authenticity of a reality-show competition. Each of those videos gets millions of views, sometimes tens of millions, on YouTube. The complaints of his neighbors became a major story arc for his vlog, complete with a fake-arrest prank. With Paul, everything becomes content.Which is perhaps why Paul’s plan to go to Texas and help was met with skepticism by the YouTube community outside of his fan base. They believed that it would be well within Paul’s character to head into a natural disaster just for the vlog. Paul appeared dead-set on personally rescuing people from flooded houses in Houston, something he said he wanted to do, several times over the course of his announcement. Yes, the star had set up a GoFundMe page and was selling a Harvey-themed T-shirt with the intention of donating proceeds to Harvey victims. But literally saving lives, on camera, would make for better footage.Paul was in Texas by Tuesday night, and he almost immediately made the news for causing chaos. The star planned to bring drinking water to people in Houston and wanted to show the world the power of the Jake Paulers by enlisting local fans to fill up two U-Haul trucks with donations. He gave out the address for a Walmart parking lot and said he personally would be there to help collect any donations his fans could get there. According to at least one local media report, more than a thousand fans — many young teens and their parents — showed up. Police told the San Antonio Express-News that it doesn’t appear that Paul had coordinated his plan with Walmart ahead of time.In his vlog about the donation drive, Paul shows the view from inside the car the moment he arrives. Gleeful fans with cellphones out charge at his car as he honks and yells, “Stay back!”“Guys, the meetup is out of control,” Paul said later, into the camera. “We’re trying to get people supplies, but no one is really cooperating.”Naturally, a bunch of people in the crowd were also vlogging Paul’s arrival in San Antonio, and these videos show more of the chaos than what is visible in Paul’s own account. One dad, there with his kids, filmed a crowd of young teenagers running into a ditch to get closer to Paul’s car, some dropping their water donations as they ran toward the star. Another series of videos shows Paul standing on top of the truck, trying — and mostly failing — to get the screaming crowd of teenagers to calm down. He seems overwhelmed.“You guys are acting like animals!” Paul shouted from the top of his car, speaking without a microphone or megaphone. “Everyone calm down. We’re not here for a meet-and-greet. We’re here to get supplies to the people in Hurricane Harvey. How are we going to help them if you guys are just bombarding and punching each other? We’re here to get supplies into a U-Haul truck.”Yet another video from the crowd shows fans climbing on top of the water scooters hooked up to the trailer of Paul’s truck as he drove through the crowd. (The team rented the personal watercraft, Paul had explained in his vlog, to get around in Houston to help with rescue efforts.) The kids, some standing precariously on the trailer rig while the car was moving, posed for selfies.Paul later described the donation drive as “really chaotic” but “super successful.” He’d accomplished his goal: two fan-filled U-Haul trucks, packed with supplies. They unloaded the water at a food bank, a process Paul documented for his vlog the next day.If Paul wants his trip to Houston to be taken as something more than vlog fodder, the obstacles to doing so are partially of his own making. When you live your life for the vlog, separating the vlog from the person becomes almost impossible. And Paul has turned his good deeds into social media weapons before. Earlier this month, he released a song about being the subject of unfavorable media coverage, in which he compares the onslaught of criticism to being lynched and berates the media for not covering the good things he says he has done.“Where was y’all at when I was on the email, trying to stop depressed fans from killing themselves,” he sings. “Where was y’all at when I was in the kitchen whipping up meals for kids on Thanksgiving?”“You think you know me,” he said. “But that ain’t on the news.”By Wednesday, it appeared that Paul had fulfilled his original goal for the trip. Paul tweeted that he had made it to Houston and showed himself in an Instagram Story standing with local firefighters and police officers, whom he said he was working with. On another Instagram post overnight, he said he was involved in rescuing eight people from their homes.this breaks my heart.. this is one of the many families evacuating their homes in Houston. The Hurricane is now hitting Port Arthur.. if you're anywhere near there please evacuate immediately.. also, If you look closely the girl in this picture is wearing a Team 10 shirt… This is heart breaking… This is why we are here ground floor in Houston… there are tons of people & tons of families & Jake Paulers who need our help & rescuing. This makes me want to work all throughout the night to save people. Today we pulled 8 people out of their homes & got them to safety. We are doing everything we can but we still need your help.. & any help we can get ground floor on Houston.. pls send prayers & pls donate to any fund or cause that you can.. thank youA post shared by Jake Paul (@jakepaul) on Aug 30, 2017 at 10:33pm PDT“There are tons of people & tons of families & Jake Paulers who need our help & rescuing,” he wrote. “This makes me want to work all throughout the night to save people.”His millions of fans will find out more in his next vlog.Update: Said vlog published a few minutes after we first published our story.

      `SAN FRANCISCO — YouTube star Logan Paul is back after a three-week break from the streaming service, officially launching his redemption tour with a video on suicide prevention in which he pledges to donate $1 million to organizations on the front lines."It's time to start a new chapter in my life as I continue to educate both myself and others on suicide," Paul says in the video, which has been viewed more than 10 million times and was the top trending video on YouTube.The 22-year-old vlogger is trying to repair the damage to the mini-digital empire he built out of his prank-and-stunt-filled daily missives on YouTube watched by millions of followers, many of them tweens, teens and kids. His video showing a dead body hanging from a tree in Aokigahara, the Japanese "suicide forest" where dozens of corpses are discovered every year, fetched millions of views before Paul took it down. Millions more viewers tuned into his apology. Earlier this month, Google lowered the boom on Paul with a punishment for the "suicide forest" video that limits his earning power and visibility on YouTube. Paul was dropped by Google Preferred, a special advertising program that connects top YouTube channels with brand advertisers, and from Foursome, a series on YouTube Red, the premium subscription service.The backlash reverberated through his young fan base and with parents who blocked their kids from watching Paul. YouTube, too, came under fire for its lax approach to the billions of videos that stream through the service."I've never been so humbled in my life by a single event," Logan says as he meets with a suicide survivor and experts in suicide prevention. The tone of Paul's latest video is strikingly different, and the message it sends far more positive and life-affirming, the result he says of three weeks spent understanding "the complexity" of suicide. He chalks up his lack of sensitivity during his visit to Aokigahara, in part, to having never known anyone who committed suicide even though he was raised in Ohio, where it's the second leading cause of death. "We have to change the conversation publicly from just focusing on suicide and how something bad is happening and say: What do we do about it?" Dr. John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, tells Paul, who says he has earmarked $250,000 for the group. "One of the things that's so important about reducing stigma is getting stories out there about people positively coping with suicide."One of those stories belongs to Kevin Hines, author of the memoir, Cracked, Not Broken: Surviving and Thriving After a Suicide Attempt, who in 2000 survived a suicide jump from the Golden Gate Bridge. He was 19 at the time."I am grateful today for every millisecond I get to breathe," he tells Paul. "Because it was almost all ripped from me by me."Some fellow YouTubers applauded the new video as a good first step."Logan Paul has a long way to go and people are right to continue to question his motives but today's video was a thoughtful first step," Casey Neistat wrote on Twitter. "Hopefully this is part of a true effort to move on from sensationalist content."Others were more skeptical. YouTube creator Jimmy Wong took issue with Paul's track record of using other people "as props and accessories.""Hey Logan. You're not solving a real issue when you address the one thing you just happened to get caught about. You're just covering your ass," Wong wrote.For days, Paul's family teased his return on their own vlogging channels. Brother Jake Paul, a YouTube star in his own right, discussed his brother's glib suicide video for the first time, saying his brother had learned from his mistakes and would "bounce back." Will he? Paul's young fans —  who call themselves the "Logang" —  never abandoned him. In fact, since his video in the suicide forest, he has gained subscribers.According to Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Paul returned to YouTube too soon. "He needed to stay dark and in a no WiFi cave. He’s too radioactive to do a re-entry right now," Schiffer said in an email.But, Schiffer says, Logan staged a successful comeback, and probably bigger than ever, "with the right acts of compassion, humility, and time."`
      `LOS ANGELES — Logan Paul, 2018's new major problem for YouTube, has gotten into more hot water with the Google-owned video network. The issue this time — a rat and the Tide Pods challenge.YouTube said it would "temporarily" suspend ads on his popular YouTube channel after Paul — one of the top-earning creators on the network — shocked a rat in a recent video with a Taser. Also Paul on Twitter, in a since-deleted tweet, suggested he'd eat a Tide Pod for every retweet from his 4.2 million followers — an attempted joke aimed at a dangerous, Internet-fueled teen trend of swallowing the colorful detergent packets for views. In recent weeks, such prank videos have emerged on YouTube, and the service has been struggling to take them down as soon as they are flagged. U.S. poison centers in January reported 142 incidents from individuals taking the "Tide Pod Challenge."More: YouTube cracks down on Tide Pod challenge videosRelated: Tide Pods: Despite 'The Challenge,' P&G doubles down on detergent pouchesPaul, who earned an estimated $12.5 million last year, according to Forbes, has been in the crosshairs of YouTube this year, though it's hardly dented his popularity among his largely teen and kid fan base.On New Year's Eve, Paul posted a video of a trip to a forest in Japan known for suicides, in which he filmed an apparent suicide victim and his own incredulous reaction. YouTube responded to the public backlash by taking Paul out of its preferred program, which gives higher ad revenues to video creators with large followings, and canceled plans to make a movie with Paul for its premium YouTube Red service. Paul posted an apology video ("So sorry.") that reeled in 50 million views but also a second round of condemnation by those who wondered if he was simply capitalizing on his mistake. Then, after taking a three-week break, he tried to show followers he had turned over a new leaf, posting a lengthier video on suicide prevention that was viewed more 27 million times. He appeared on Good Morning America. Along with selling "merchandise" and other deals, YouTube is where Paul makes money. His channel has 16 million subscribers and over 3 billion views for his videos. Unlike other social networks that bring exposure to young people looking to make a name for themselves, like Facebook and Twitter, YouTube rewards them with financial incentives by sharing ad revenues.Anyone can be a YouTube star if they can pull in viewers. The most successful ones do it by being provocative, an incentive to constantly up the ante. YouTube is full of prank videos of people pulling out chairs behind unsuspecting souls, waving fake snakes at them, putting weird things into doughnuts and watching unsuspecting folks eat them. In a recent video blog, Paul shows himself operating a Taser on what he says is a dead rat to make sure it's dead. The video is age-restricted, which means younger YouTube users can't watch it.

These videos drew in a combined 60 million views. A petition on Change.Org is calling for YouTube to delete the Logan Paul channel. So far, over 500,000 people have signed up.YouTube wouldn't comment on deleting his channel, but YouTube terms of service say that if a channel gets three strikes it will take more action. Logan Paul's representatives did not immediately return a request for comment.`
      `YouTube star Logan Paul apologized for posting a video showing an apparent suicide victim in Japan's "suicide forest," drawing condemnation for appearing to use the death for comic purposes.   The video, entitled "We saw a dead body in the Japanese Suicide Forest," featured Paul and several friends arriving to camp at the forest, officially known as Aokigahara. After the group ventured off the trail, they happen upon an apparent suicide victim hanging from a tree. Paul and company then decide to venture closer to the body, filming their reactions along the way. The video shows several close-ups of the victim's body, though the victim's face is blurred. Paul warns viewers that the video is graphic and remarks that he thinks it is "a moment in YouTube historybecause I’m pretty sure this has never hopefully happened to anyone on YouTube ever.”  He says suicide is "not the answer" before jokingly replying to an off-camera, apparently distraught friend saying "what, you've never seen a dead guy before?"   The video was pulled from Paul's official YouTube channel but was re-uploaded by other users on the service. Paul became a trending topic on Twitter late Monday night, with celebrities and other YouTubers joining others on the Internet criticizing him for even posting the video that jokes about suicide.It's the latest instance that Google-owned YouTube has taken heat for user-generated content that's popular with kids — and frequently makes its amateur creators money — but that has disturbing or adult themes. YouTube has vowed to crack down on videos that exploit children and to impose tighter filters for content that requires age restrictions.

Fire officials save himMore: On YouTube, sexualized 'Frozen' and Nickelodeon cartoons aren't barred from kidsIn a statement Tuesday, YouTube said the video violated its Community Guideline policies and shared condolences to the family of the person who appeared in the video.  "YouTube prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner," reads an excerpt of YouTube's statement. "If a video is graphic, it can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information and in some cases it will be age-gated."According to New York magazine, which saw the original video before it was pulled, the video garnered over 6 million views in the 24 hours after it was published. The original video also apparently included information for the American Society for Suicide Prevention.In a second apology posted to his channel Tuesday, Paul said he regrets posting the video. "There's a lot of things I should've done differently, but I didn't," he said. "And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry."Paul, 22, rose to Internet fame using the now-defunct video sharing service Vine. He has since transitioned to making videos on YouTube, where he is one of the site's biggest stars with over 15 million subscribers along with his over 3.9 million followers on Twitter. According to Forbes, he earned $12.5 million last year. Paul's videos, often of various pranks and outrageous stunts, frequently get several million views from his "Logang" fanbase. In an apology posted to his Twitter account late Monday, Paul said that he "never faced criticism like this before and didn't post the video "for views." Instead, the note continues, Paul says he wanted to "raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention."`

Paul, who took a three week hiatus after being universally slammed for picturing a suicide victim and laughing as they hung from a tree in Japan last year, uploaded the new video to his channel on Monday.It showed him padding around his $6.5million mansion in Encino, California, showing off his 'Maverick' merchandise and leading viewers out onto his bedroom balcony where the two dead rodents were. He said the had been brought there by his Pomeranian Kong. An assistant later admitted to putting one there. With the same assistant and another friend by his side, Paul stood over the dead rodents on his balcony and pondered how to get rid of them.He then shocked the group by producing the taser, screaming: 'No rat comes into my house without getting tased!' The 22-year-old then administered several electric currents to fry the already motionless animals as his assistant screamed: 'Why?' After firing his taser, he used the electric wire still connected to one of the rodents to lift it into the air. The camera zoomed in on its body. Later, after they had been place into a large trash can, Paul tasered them again.'Why? It's already dead! Why?' his assistant yelled. Earlier in the video, he was filmed scooping out a languid fish from his extravagant coy pond and giving it CPR to 'revitalize it'.

They took to Twitter to complain in their droves about Paul's ongoing insensitivity.'I'd love to say Logan Paul has changed and learnt to respect dead things since coming back on YouTube.'But now he's just tasering them instead,' said Twitter user Elliot Hackney. 'Logan Paul reckons he's a changed man since returning to YouTube; especially after the...incident a few weeks back. Now he's tasering dead rats; how is this acceptable?' asked John Armstrong. 'At least he moved on from dead people to dead fish and dead rats,' quipped another.

On January 31, he appalled viewers by uploading footage of a suicide victim hanging from a tree in a forest in Japan. Paul and his friends had jokingly gone to spend the night in the woodland and giggled how they told viewers that it was 'haunted' by the souls of the thousands who take their lives there. They came across the man by accident but continued rolling and zoomed in on his dead body as Paul shouted: 'Are you f**** with us bro?' before calling police. He was universally condemned and took the footage down not long after it was posted, later posting a grovelling Twitter apology before signing off. He dedicated his first video back to suicide prevention and pledged $1million to charities which support the issue.Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5363111/Logan-Paul-tasers-two-dead-rats-new-controversial-video.html#ixzz56jmkYB00 Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on FacebookVowing to 'be better', he said solemnly to the camera: 'I was ignorant.'His humility did not last long. Just a few days after the video was uploaded, Paul played the victim during an interview on Good Morning America where he bemoaned the fact that the scandal had lost him millions of dollars. 'It's been tough, cause ironically I'm being told to commit suicide myself,' said Paul.'Millions of people literally telling me they hate me, to go die in a fire. Like, the most horrible, horrific things.' He then told interviewer Michael Strahan that the fault lay with the parents of teenagers who allow them to browse the internet unmonitored. 'I'm going to be honest with you, Michael, I think - I think parents should be monitoring what their children are watching more,' said Paul.'Every parent I meet whose kids are under the age of 9 or 12, I go, "Hey, you let your kids watch my stuff." And they go, "Yeah, what am I going to do?" But at the same time it's not like I'm a bad guy. I am a good guy who made a bad decision.' On February 4, two days after the interview, he posted a video to his vlogs channel where he jokingly referred to the scandal and his break from the spotlight.Appearing on a beach as a dishevelled wreck, he argued with a spoof commentator who, in a voiceover, labeled him a disgrace, saying: 'What you mean disgraced? Boy I took a break. Besides, I'm still lit AF.'What other YouTuber you know can take a three week break and still get A MILLION SUBSCRIBERS?'In that video, he appeared shirtless with a fish on a spear. On Tuesday night, with the criticism for his latest video growing, Paul returned home to his luxury house to find an intruder sitting on his couch, charging his phone. He made a citizen's arrest then waited for police to arrive, according to TMZ.Sources said the man was a fan who simply wanted to meet the internet star. Paul and his brother Jake are among the highest-earning YouTube stars in the world.Like his brother, Jake has run into controversy.  Earlier this month, he was filmed rapping the N-word during a freestyle performance in one video. He has also terrorized neighbors in the plush California enclave of Calabasas where he owns a $6million home. `
      `The 20-year-old intruder who was placed under citizen's arrest by disgraced vlogger Logan Paul has been sentenced to 30 days in jail.The man, who has not been identified, struck a plea deal when he appeared in court on Thursday and entered a no contest plea for aggravated trespass, according to TMZ.He was sentenced to 30 days behind bars and 24 months probation, the L.A. City Attorney's Office told TMZ. He was also ordered to stay away from Paul's block.Paul, 22, performed the arrest after returning to his San Fernando Valley home at around 10pm Tuesday, where he discovered the man sitting on his couch charging his phone.Police were notified and the man was booked for criminal trespass.The man had reportedly wanted to meet the YouTube star, law enforcement told the website.Several people were upstairs at the time the intruder entered the home through an unlocked front door.However, the individuals inside the property thought they had heard Paul entering the residence.Paul has taken a three week hiatus after being universally slammed for picturing a suicide victim and laughing as they hung from a tree in Japan last year.On December 31, he uploading footage of the victim hanging from a tree in a forest.Paul and his friends had gone to spend the night in the forest and giggled as they told viewers that it was 'haunted' by the souls of the thousands who take their lives there.They came across the man by accident but continued rolling and zoomed in on his dead body as Paul shouted: 'Are you f****** with us bro?' before calling police.He was widely condemned and took the footage down not long after it was posted, later posting a grovelling Twitter apology before signing off.He dedicated his first video back to suicide prevention and pledged $1million to charities which support the issue.But on Friday, YouTube suspended ads on his channels citing the troubled star's 'recent pattern of behavior'.The decision from YouTube came just days after he tweeted Monday that he would swallow a Tide Pod for every retweet. That same day he tasered two dead rats and removed a live fish from water and 'performed CPR' on it.'In response to Logan Paul's recent pattern of behaviour,' YouTube tweeted on Friday, 'we've temporarily suspended ads on his channels.'A spokeswoman said: 'This is not a decision we made lightly, however, we believe he has exhibited a pattern of behaviour in his videos that makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers, but also potentially damaging to the broader creator community.'According to the website Social Blade, which estimates influencers’ earnings from their online statistics, Paul may have earned at least $43,000 from ad revenue on YouTube in the last month alone, despite taking the break.`
      `He found himself at the center of a massive controversy after filming a hanging body in Japan's Aokigahara, known as a 'suicide forest.'And Logan Paul, a YouTube star now facing punitive consequences from the website that made him famous, was seen on a night out Saturday.The 22-year-old was seen shielding his face with one hand as he stepped out to Tao Los Angeles, and was also spotted in a car with some pals.Scroll down for videoLogan had stuck to his typical casual look, flinging a denim jacket over a grey hoodie, which in turn he wore on top of a black tee.The brother of Jake Paul rolled up the hems of his skintight black pants, which he had matched with a pair of black shoes.Around New Year's, Logan was appearing in a vlog in which he and his friends were walking through the Aokigahara and found the apparent dead man.Filming continued, and at one point, Logan said solemnly to the camera: 'Suicide is not a joke. Depression and mental illnesses, they're not - are not a joke.'He went on to say: 'We came here with an intent to focus on the haunted aspect of the forest. This just became very real, and obviously a lot of people are going through a lot of s*** in their lives.'At one point, off-screen, one of his friends could be heard saying: 'I don't feel very good,' to which another added: 'Yeah, I don't feel good either.'Logan deadpanned: 'What, you never stand next to a dead guy?'Soon after, the video showed him unable to restrain a brief bout of what looked like nervous laughter.On New Year's Day, after the video set off a storm of anger on Twitter, Logan tweeted an apology statement for the video, which was unmonetized.'I intended to raise awareness for suicide prevention and while I thought "if this video saves just ONE life, it'll be worth it," I was misguided by shock and awe, as portrayed in the video,' read the statement in part. 'I still am.'During an apology video posted January 2, Logan said solemnly that 'I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement and I don't expect to be forgiven.'In a statement posted to Twitter on Tuesday, YouTube had written: 'Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views. As Anna Akana put it perfectly: "That body was a person someone loved. You do not walk into a suicide forest with a camera and claim mental health awareness."'The site also noted: 'We expect more of the creators who build their community on @YouTube, as we’re sure you do too. The channel violated our community guidelines, we acted accordingly, and we are looking at further consequences.'As the week wore on, YouTube revealed that it 'decided to remove Logan Paul's channels from Google Preferred,' CNN reported.His forthcoming YouTube film The Thinning: New World Order is now 'on hold' and he has been fired from the site's series Foursome.`
